C1,waking up is something we all to do every day should not it be stress free possible
C9,inspired by clinical sleep research the up light is a smart bulb that helps you wake up naturally feeling refreshed
C10,and all you to do is change a light bulb
C10,the up light is the smartest light bulb you ever experienced
C10,it is a bluetoothenabled energy efficient multicolored bulb that installs in your bedside lamp
C10,the free up light is extremely user friendly and gives you full control of your lighting from your smart phone or tablet
C10,using only watts it reduces your energy costs and lasts up to years while delivering a wake up experience we think you will love
C10,it is simple
C10,no hubs no wifi connections no additional clutter your nightstand
C10,if you know how to replace a standard light bulb and download the up light is you
C10,it is smart
C10,the up light is designed to provide the right light at the right times to promote sleep wellness
C9,it is science
C9,sleep specialists using light therapy years to help treat sleep phase disorders and we use it ourselves
C9,the same reason sleep doctors tell you to not stare at smart phones or screens at night light has a tremendous impact your sleep wellness
C9,in the evenings light can keep your body from releasing your sleep hormones and in the morning it tells your body when to start your wake and sleep cycles
C9,the science behind it allthe science behind it all
C1,working professionals
C1,waking up work is not always easy especially if you early meetings or late night calls
C10,the up light gently reminds your body of it is proper wake up time in the morning to help keep you track while reducing the bluegreen light in the evening it is easier to fall asleep
C1,parents
C1,let us face it struggling to your kids out of bed every morning is not a fun experience
C1,the up light provides morning stimulation with the same white light that studies shown to help reset circadian rhythms and help them wake up their own naturally
C1,travelersroad warriors
C10,with a durable aluminum casing and no hubs or wifi networks to set up the up light is ultra portable
C10,pack it in your suitcase and swap out the bulb in your hotel room
C1,students
C1,it is never easy waking up early class especially if you were up late working your paper or ummm partying
C10,the up light helps provide the extra stimulation in the morning to make it easier getting up help you back schedule
C9,heres a chart that summarize what makes the up light unique we did lots of research and testing to empower you with the ability to customize your wake up experience while keeping it very simple and intuitive to use
C2,founder steve the night owl chang realized when he married his early bird wife in how happy and incredibly productive she was
C2,try he could he could not naturally wake up in the mornings and it became a passion of his to figure out why
C2,over time steve learned about delayed sleep phase and the effects of light the body
C2,in late steve had the opportunity to participate at startup weekend san diego when he had the privilege of pitching the idea to his team and together they ended up winning place
C5,while his teammates had other commitments steve got much positive feedback he was inspired to continue work project to bring it life
C9,he spoke with numerous doctors and sleep specialists to truly understand the science and requirements
C2,he found a manufacturer who had years of experience with the technology and could build a high quality product at lower cost that the average person could afford it
C2,the result was the up light
C2,some photos of our journey
C2,steve presenting at startup weekend san diegosteve presenting at startup weekend san diego
C4,behind the scenes testing testing and testingbehind the scenes testing testing and testing
C4,testing our prototypes
C4,far we several working prototypes that steve his family and friends testing and using with great success
C2,we are making some final adjustments to our firmware and perfecting our
C6,your funds will help turn dream into a reality and help bring product that can help make mornings easier everyone
C6,your funds will be used to
C3,complete the development
C7,help pay our cost of goods production order and certifications
C7,bring the up light to market
C2,i was never a morning person
C1,you feeling of dread feeling like you are going to be tired the rest of the day
C1,you hit the snooze button hoping that in minutes you d feel refreshed but it never really came you never really felt that way and you kind of muddle through the rest of your day
C1,what would it be like if you can wake up your own without alarm
C1,how would it feel what would you do
C10,that is what we set out to do with the up light
C10,the up light prepares your body waking up and helps reset your sleep clock you start waking up naturally
C10,it is got million colors it uses the latest version of bluetooth it automatically pairs
C10,there are no wifi networks hubs or other accessories you to buy
C10,it is really easy to use
C10,you simply replace your current bulb download the and it connects automatically
C10,set your wake up time and the next morning the uplights starts training your body to wake up naturally
C10,there are a lot other smartbulbs out there today but none of them are completely dedicated to helping you wake up
C2,we want to make that a seamless a perfect experience
C2,think about way
C9,you know how a lot of sleep doctors tell you not to start your screens late at night
C9,the reason is because even the smallest dose of the light is enough to keep your body from producing the right hormones at the right time and we thought let us flip that around
C9,let us use light to wake us up in the morning and at night take out those harmful colors of light that keep you awake it is conducive to sleep
C1,we created the up lights average people like me who would never imagined what it would be like to be a morning person
C1,we created with travelers in mind it is got a durable aluminum casing you can take it with you
C1,we created it students with early classes and the parents who to wake him up
C2,we a daughter who is wonderful and has a love life but she hit phase where she could not herself out of bed and we put the up light in her room and over the next couple of days she started waking up her own
C2,she was happy she was excited about her day
C10,there is no nagging no frustrations it was not stressful it worked
C2,we working very closely with our manufacturers and we created the up light using a tested design that it be reliable and it is production ready we are finalizing our firmware and making finishing touches our
C7,we wanted to be perfect and that is where you come in with your help we can place our orders production and make the up light available everyone
C1,think is every day of your life every single day should not it be a natural and stress free experience

C10,wake function
C10,there you it
C10,back to the future may be fictional but the machine that converts food scraps into energy is here because we built it
C10,is a living machine that eats food scraps and makes energy and plant food using microbes with zero waste
C10,it is called the horse
C10,it is portable
C10,it is affordable
C10,it creates jobs and independence from fossil fuel energy and landfilling
C8,we blew through the barrier but we are running out of time
C8,we added a new reward to invite small backers to make a fresh pledge
C8,magnetic sign is carrying the message your tailgate
C9,of what we throw away is biodegradable food landscape waste paper wood and the solution is within our reach locally
C9,worse yet of all the food we produce never gets eaten
C9,food waste is nearly all going to landfills in north america
C7,join us in revolutionizing the way we create and distribute renewable energy by backing the horse project
C10,the horse will eradicate curbside garbage pickup and the carbon emissions associated with long distance trucking
C10,creating a whole new shared carbonnegative transportation model local use less trucking no landfilling renewable energy
C10,combined benefit is disruptive and huge it is decentralized it is portable it is affordable
C1,imagine a technology that can divert waste and create energy offgrid
C1,imagine eliminating the organic waste from your trashcan
C1,imagine making it into two valuable new resources that you can personally or commercially use
C6,our crowd sourcing goal is to both connect likeminded people and to raise enough money to build a containerized version of the horse
C2,the one you see in campaign is going to surrey british columbia our canadian friends will enjoy the one
C1,is how henry ford conceived the model t
C2,is how doc brown conceived the flux capacitor
C2,they inspired us
C6,fords vision was a horseless carriage constructed of the best materials by the best people available using the simplest designs that technology can devise
C6,our vision is a horse with the same characteristics
C2,a century later we are taking it up a notch with biomimicry a machine designed to behave like nature intended
C1,the future is in the year
C6,the vision is to become selfsufficient and to make renewable energy your property and fertilize your own or a nearby garden or farm to grow food and flowers
C10,the horse is both a sustainability and society game changer
C10,it is all about the quadruple bottom line people planet profit and progress
C9,there are restaurants and college campuses in north america
C1,each one should their own horse
C1,imagine the sustainable energy revolution islands resorts zoos museums schools parks convention centers farmers markets music venues apartments and corporate and municipal campuses they turn food scraps into energy
C1,is the beginning
C10,what goes in and what comes out
C10,it will consume tons per year of food scraps beverages fat and paper products
C10,it can create gallons per year of liquid fertilizer up to mwhrs of raw energy
C10,renewable gas that is million btu per year mwhrs of energy is electrical output
C10,the system has accessory valves bbq grills fire pits lights and ovens
C1,how cool is that here is what that means in everyday terms
C5,if you pledge you will be part of the community supported biocycling csb learning community
C10,biocycling means sustainably recycling biodegradable materials like food scraps into something of value
C10,will be a sustaining forum to develop projects share experiences successes challenges ideas and innovation
C10,csb is the operating system the horse
C10,csb is designed to help others run kickstarter campaigns or other initiatives to funding a horse of their own including copy video other media and best practices we identified in running a kickstarter to funding impact unit and onsite bioenergy generation
C4,we a specific csb project in seattle and are hoping to build a demonstration to allow early adopters and innovators a chance to operate system
C5,we can build many projects the campaign supports jump horse with us is the logo we created our csb community
C10,it puts a face our operating system that people can recognize and use at restaurants community gardens and other public places
C10,enabling food waste to food resource
C8,why pledge one without receiving a cool gadget because it is about future generations and paying it forward
C8,we come up with some cool rewards in the pledge levels even though campaign has a social and environmental purpose
C7,check them out
C7,with your help innovative machine can make a really big difference

C2,doc says roads where we are going we do not any roads
C10,the horse can take a wide range of organic wastes including kitchen trim postconsumer dining room food scraps meat grease oil all edible liquids seafood dairy products starch sugar fruit vegetable small bones soiled paper products napkins tissue paper towels waxed paper grass clippings leaves fats fryer oil grease trap waste beverages alcohol soup condiments eggshells glycerin etc
C10,if a real horse cannot eat it you should not put it in one
C10,example no plastics glass or metal
C10,no soap or cleaning products
C10,too much salt is a bad idea
C10,alcoholic beverages brewery yeast distillery stillage and dairy whey are ok
C10,wood is not bad but not helpful
C10,avoid things that will kill bacteria
C10,the cost of a horse is
C6,we set the crowdfunding goal low but we high hopes to give birth to two horses from campaign
C8,while the kickstarter platform has a limit of we are prepared to credit of any pledge toward a subsequent purchase of a horse or before april
C10,will really surprise you our horse works around the clock to perpetually recover the power embedded in food waste
C10,when generating electricity energy converts into about kwh per year
C1,if a tesla gets around miles per kwh our horse could power that tesla to go about miles per year
C1,not bad
C1,keep in mind that car weighs tons though
C2,to improve transportation productivity we decided to lose the unnecessary weight and create a carbon neutral urban cargo tricycle powered by human and electric motorhub
C1,let us go backtothefuture and call the horsepowered carriage
C10,fully loaded carriage weighs around tons
C10,we can squeeze the work out of every kwh and transport stuff miles per kwh
C10,that is a x improvement in electric vehicle productivity or about miles per year mindblowing combination could be the nextgen horse and carriage from waste to wheels
C10,lb of food scraps can fuel mile of electric transport in todays budgeting dollars work is valued at in transportation and disposal and mtcoe of emissions
C10,impact bioenergy is the core technology provider designer builder and supplier of the horse digester
C10,csb is the service end of a strategic partnering program that helps remove barriers to market and deploy transformational technology in different locations
C10,it is a partnering program between organizations such food banks schools restaurants breweries distilleries markets urban farmers gardeners and other forprofit or nonprofit ventures
C9,biocycling is the recycling of organic materials
C10,in the context of our project term describes the process of taking organic wastes such food scraps and converting it into liquid fertilizer and energy that can once be used directly the farm at these food resources were originally produced
C2,we like to say
C2,farm to fork to fertilizer and fuel and back to the farm again
C10,why the horse why not compost
C10,composting is awesome but many food wastes are too wet and dense to compost easily
C10,it is far better to digest the food wastes conserves all the nitrogen and water harvest the energy and make liquid fertilizer
C10,the liquid can be used to irrigate compost and make the compost even better
C10,the digester biogas production capture reduces greenhouse gas emissions and can be used gas or used to make light heat electricity or cng vehicle fuel
C10,the horse requires about hours of work per week that involves loading feed mixing the digester contents checking readings and drawing off the liquid needed
C6,future designs will increased automation capabilities to reduce the daily maintenance requirement
C10,a horse deployment creates local jobs and operating personnel will be hired at each project location
C9,the horse mimics processes that occur in digestion system of a ruminant like a cow
C10,horse stands highsolids organicwaste recycling system with electric output
C1,imagine a world where you do not to export your trash and you do not to import your food
C1,imagine a truly organic cycle where uneaten food returns energy and fertalizer to the earth
C1,imagine saving money
C1,imagine food and energy security everyone
C2,hi my name is jan ellen i am the founder of impact bioenergy
C2,we invented a beautiful piece of machinery that is both portable and simple
C2,over the past year we quietly working the vision and design of the horse
C10,a compact clean and awesome looking machine to upcycle organic waste at its source
C10,the horse consumes tonnes a year of food waste paper products fats beverages and grass clippings
C10,it produces gallons a year of fertilizer and megawatt hours of raw energy
C10,it makes megawatt hours of electricity that is a total of million btus of renewable energy
C2,we design the horse to serve about people or less
C10,it is about the size of a car and it cost about what a car would cost
C10,is a way individuals to own their own energy in food cycles
C10,it can be installed at a restaurant at a grocery store casino
C10,it is mobile they can go to farmers markets and it can ideally be put at schools in campuses educational opportunities
C2,we do not a big venture capital partner to industrialize technology
C2,we want bionenergy to propergate at the grassroots level zealots leaders and early adopters to help bring project to reality
C2,we thinkers doers zealots leaders and early adopters to help bring project to reality
C6,our crowd funding goal is to raise enough money to at least two horses the ground and running in the seattle area
C7,check out the pledge levels the web page they are progressive starting with simple pledges going all the way up to owning a horse of your own
C6,every dollar raised with project will go to building a network of off grid micro power generators fueled by food scraps
C7,thanks listening
C2,we want you to be part of the horse project

C10,skybuds presented a unique challenge from a size standpoint
C2,we needed to create earbud that fit comfortably in everyones ear that at the same time was small enough to fit into a smartphone case while minimizing bulk
C10,the design needed to be functional simple and elegant
C2,we began by extensively analyzing ears to figure out the various shapes sizes and fit points
C9,skybuds fit studyskybuds fit study
C10,ergonomic fit was our key parameter and focus
C4,we conducted hundreds of ear size tests and studies and even mapped out many of the ears in d that we could conduct thorough analyses through cad to understand shape
C4,d rendering of a common ear shape and skybuds concept sketchesd rendering of a common ear shape and skybuds concept sketches
C2,after we developed understanding of the ear shape and size we spent months figuring out the most comfortable and secure shape the earbud
C2,we incorporated a significant amount of components into extremely small form factor
C4,after dozens of different id prototypes we found a design that securely and comfortably fits in nearly every ear
C2,some of our iterations the skybuds shape
C2,finally we were able to arrive at a shape that our studies indicated would fit the vast majority of peoples ears

C6,our design objective the case was to minimize size
C2,a design with minimal bulk was imperative if users felt encumbered by our case they would balk at our value proposition
C10,a tapered design unique among phone cases allows the phone to lie naturally flat a table while still providing a thicker portion at one end the earbuds
C2,we spent a significant time studying the angle of the taper that the phone screen was still fully visible when in a resting position a flat surface
C2,we faced the unique challenge of finding a solution in skybuds and the case could seamlessly live together
C3,we carefully studied and tested the most natural way consumers would interact with earbuds and designed a patented minimal bulk case that solves these issues
C9,after numerous ux studies we
C10,determined that the most natural earbud orientation was at the base of the phone studies indicated of users felt was the natural position and
C10,designed a protective enclosure that would provide easy access to the earbuds
C10,each aperture has a reinforcing metal ring to fortify the structure and shield the earbuds during drops
C10,furthermore we incorporated a mechanical pushpush design successfully pops out and locks the earbuds during removalinsertion while still accommodating every finger type e
C2,we reimagined the experience of interacting with your headphones
C4,note the skybud in the ear is a prototype not the final product
C10,from a system architecture standpoint we use a combination of bluetooth classic ble nfmi and electrical contacts to ensure reliable communication throughout our system
C10,earbud earbud communication sending a stereo audio stream to earbuds is not possible using the standard adp profile it is a pointtopoint relay system we implemented a technology called near field magnetic induction
C10,each earbud has a coil the primary earbud modulates a tight lowpower non propagating localized magnetic field is measured by the receiver coil in the other earbud
C10,earbud phone communication we implemented a new finishing technique known selective nanoplating
C9,nanoplating is a coating process that deposits multiplemicron thickness layers of metal onto the exterior surfaces
C9,a nanoplated finish significantly improves the rf performance of the internal bt classic and ble antennas
C2,we wanted to give our consumers the best sound possible we incorporated in each skybud
C10,a balanced armature driver that was bigger the typical ones used in inear earbuds higher spl level and range and a digital mems microphone that picks up sound clearly either microphone use during a call or passive noise cancellation
C4,our team spent eight months architecting developing and building our batch of working prototypes es i
C4,the es i working prototypethe es i working prototype
C2,we found that the antenna performance in es i was not meeting our standards we switched over to nfmi solution when we started developing es ii in july
C4,with help from our odm we locked down a design schematics and layout and begun building es ii results look good and we are excited to receive and test es ii prototypes later autumn
C2,alpha audiotronics inc alpha is a team passionate about conveniently delivering wireless sound
C2,we love music and technology
C2,we like to experience the world with our own personal soundtrack to match our moods and actions are constantly changing
C2,we are constantly the go juggling busy schedules and belongings and wanting things to be faster smoother and streamlined
C1,but the wires physically and literally tying our music and listening experiences were slowing us down and inhibiting our freedom
C2,we want to enhance the listening experience by removing wires our products give customers newfound mobility comfort and access to sound we provide unencumbered audio the way it was meant to be heard wherever whenever
C7,we managed to aggregate enough resources to cover development but we your help in
C2,finalizing and configuring tooling and fixtures
C2,applying certifications and approvals
C2,purchasing materials st mass production build
C2,growing our team
C2,we are launching skybuds kickstarter because we believe in collaborating with our future customers to help us develop a worldclass product
C5,kickstarter allows us to in touch with passionate likeminded forward thinkers who can provide invaluable feedback and suggestions
C7,help us share skybuds with the world using skybuds or freeyoursound
C2,we wanted to create a product that we ourselves want to use every day in developing skybuds we paid attention to the things that people cared about the most
C10,fit signal strength sound quality and battery life
C1,the real problem with wireless headphones is that they always to be charged
C1,charging anything beside your phone a day to day basis is a real inconvinience
C3,but with our patented case whenever you charge your phone you charge your earbuds
C10,it is that simple
C10,there is no to carry around a separate charging or storage device your earbuds
C10,and when you go to sleep at night and you plug in your phone not only do you wake up with a fully charged phone and fully charged earbuds but we added extra battery at the back of the case that provides additional power both of your phone and earbuds throughout the entire day
C10,truly wireless means no wires to tangled no chords to ripped out of your ears
C10,and our smart phone case allows easy place you to put your skybuds in when you are finished using them
C2,we knew that skybuds would to be the perfect companion people with very active lifestyles
C2,yes skybuds are sweat proof and to accommodate small ears like mine and much larger ears like jamies we developed interchangeable bud tips
C9,in order to make sure that skybuds fit everyones ears comfortably and securely we studied tons of records by airsergants and tested d mapped literally hundreds of years
C10,not only are skybuds gone look sharp but they are gone sound great and the connection quality is gone be excellent
C10,we put amazing speakers into both earbuds and use the process called nano bleeding to make sure that all your sound is unerrupted
C10,in terms of battery they last to hours of continuous play but remember soon you put them back in the case will start recharge
C2,we convert four products into one device your truly wireless earbuds your bluetooth headset calling smartphone case extra smartphone battery are all compressed into a single totally convenient solution that charges and stores your earbuds
C2,we living and breathing skybuds the past months but we taken it far we can since we put the best components in skybuds mass production is expensive
C7,help us by supporting skybuds and becoming early advocates of the product
C5,we are super excited to bring skybuds to you the kickstarter community and we hope you love skybuds much we do

C10,learn to code the easy way
C10,wink is arduino based robot designed to help transition students from graphical programming to powerful written code languages
C2,the scratch programming environment has become a popular way to introduce kids to basic programming concepts
C9,eventually students to move to writing actual code
C2,the wink project was born out of collaboration with educators who were looking a robot platform to bridge the simplicity of graphical style programming to real world programming languages like java python c and c
C10,easy adoption by school programs parents
C10,the wink project includes a curriculum that is free and open
C1,kids and grownups can learn at home
C1,after school programs
C1,workshops
C1,core classroom instruction
C1,clubs such girl scouts boy scouts etc
C1,maker space hacker space events
C10,teach the basics at low cost
C10,low cost robot allows students to program common robotic tasks such
C10,line following
C10,light seeking
C10,barrier detection
C10,autonomous roaming
C10,creative experimentation
C10,the robots are small and playful and require minimal storage space between instruction sessions
C2,we carefully considered the parts and sensors wink to enable students to embody the common entry level robotics concepts like line following light seeking and barrier detection
C1,wink will inspire students to experiment their own by writing involved behaviors
C10,written code is easier you think
C1,one of the reasons graphical programming like scratch is great is that it is not intimidating
C1,putting graphical puzzle pieces together that do something is easy concept to understand
C2,we taken a similar approach introducing written code
C10,students will write programs that are no intimidating the puzzle pieces they are used to
C2,we written functions that work similar to those in scratch that are super easy to understand and use
C10,while playing with the wink robot students are learning the foundation of the powerful c programming language is widely used to control the microprocessors used in all manner of robotics embedded systems automation and the growing internet of things iot revolution
C10,lesson plans video series parts
C7,by backing project you can help us finish the rest of our lesson plans
C2,we written several already and we would like to complete a series of about lessons beginning with the super basics and moving through advanced core programming concepts
C6,we will be able to finish the or written lessons
C6,these lessons will be free and open source and published pdf documents
C6,we will be able to film the guide videos the lessons will allow educators who may no programming experience of their own to host student sessions with the wink robot
C6,videos will be posted to online playlist where they can be freely viewed at any time
C6,we will be able to purchase the parts to build future stock of wink robots in larger quantity and at lower cost
C6,will allow us to offer wink to end users and educators at low cost
C10,preview lessons
C2,we published the rough draft of the four lessons below you can a feel the overall flow and style of the additional upcoming lessons
C5,lessons are written we will share them with any educators requesting copies along the way and ask feedback
C10,lesson basics
C10,lesson controlling winks eyes
C10,lesson controlling winks motors
C10,lesson user button and making sound
C10,technical specifics
C10,wink is based the popular arduino uno hardware board
C10,it is programmed using the arduino development environment is free and open source
C10,based arduino wink is based the arduino uno
C10,he has the same atmel atmegap microprocessor
C10,simple bit processor is perfect learning the basics
C10,code is written using the arduino ide is free and open source
C10,works most computers the arduino development environment runs windows mac and most linux computers
C10,fast motors winks motors are fast
C10,at full speed he can zoom across a floor or table in the wink of eye
C10,each motor can be independently driven forward or backward and at any variable speed
C10,rgb eyes winks eyes can be made any color you can think of and controlled individually to give your wink a personality
C10,eye brightness can be carefully controlled
C10,ambient light sensors three light sensors the top side can measure light from directly ahead degrees to either side
C10,the sensors enable light seeking and behaviors activated by lights
C10,barrier headlight infrared barrier headlight is tucked under winks nose
C10,can be used together with the ambient light sensors to detect obstacles several inches in front of the robot
C10,line and edge sensors array of four bottom sensors along winks front bottom allow high speed line following edge detection
C10,button you will learn how to read the user button in your code and change how wink reacts to it
C10,sound a piezo sound element allows simple tone chirps audio feedback and creating alarm behaviors
C10,battery onboard rechargeable mah lipo battery provides hours of run time
C10,charging a complete automatic charging solution is provided right onboard
C10,simply plug wink into the programming adapter and he automatically charges and stops charging when full
C10,a charge in progress led tells you when he is completely charged
C6,schedule
C2,our previous kickstarter ringo ran a bit over schedule
C2,was due to a few delays in custom parts the fact that we had way backers we would ever expected
C2,because the wink robot uses the same parts ringo and we plenty of those parts in stock in our shop we do not expect any delays from availability
C2,the only real lead time item we to order is our circuit boards
C2,we are using the same factory we ordered from many times with reliable time service
C6,to ahead of the time curve we will order the wink circuit boards before the kickstarter is even complete
C2,funds from kickstarter do not arrive until two weeks following the campaign but we can easily accommodate making at least units without these funds
C2,reason we are sure we can be that we are able to manufacture and deliver at least wink units before christmas
C8,delivery to usa backers before christmas is very likely unless something really bad happens
C8,shipping time to international backers can vary by country but international backers in the should still receive their wink units around or shortly following christmas
C8,depending how many backer units we to make additional units will ship throughout december and going into january
C2,meet the team
C2,wink and ringo are manufactured in our own family owned shop located near portland oregon
C2,kevin spends his days thinking up and designing fun stuff
C2,nona handles shipping and admin and juston is the master of the assembly machines
C2,he can solder anything
C2,our two awesome kiddos parker and hailey hang out around the shop once in a while entertaining us all
C2,they are responsible final approval of all of dads designs
C2,sadie not pictured greets the mail man daily begs treats from the ups guy chases flies and flash lights and woofs at anything that moves outside the shop
C2,hello internet my name s kevin king founder of plum geek and i am here today to introduce our newest robot wink
C2,wink was created with one idea in mind we wanted to create the easiest robot ever teaching kids to write code
C10,wink can do all the fun things you want to do with educational robot
C10,light seeking is easily done using the ambient light sensors across the front of the robot
C10,in lesson students will learn how to read sensors and use variables and make decisions based those variables
C10,wink has four sensors along it is nose that allow high speed line following and edge detection barrier and obstacle detection is possible using infrared headlights
C10,the code that allows wink to navigate maze is a lot simpler you think
C1,lots of kids that played with graphical programming systems like scratch these graphical languages are great teaching kids the basics of program flow in easy and not intimidating way
C1,but taking the next step into writing actual code can be kind of intimidated or least that is the perception
C2,we created wink to solve
C10,we designed a robot that is fun and interactive that can be program using really simple functions
C1,if you can understand the graphical functions and scratch then you will be able to understand our written functions to control wink
C2,along with the wink robot we are designing a lesson series thatll take students from the very basics of writing code all the way through the core concepts and the foundation of the c language
C10,the lessons will be accompanied by intro videos thatll allow teachers of school and workshop events to begin teaching right away even if they do not any coding experience
C10,the lesson plans designed to engage students years and older younger kids can learn with the help of a grown up
C10,ever example of every lessons is accompanied by working source code kids can jump right in and start learning and customizing
C10,in the cody example we make the robot wink his eye
C10,example is only a few lines long and anyone can understand it
C10,students can change the color of the wink they can meet the eyes alternate and they can experiment with their own sequences
C10,then we jump into making the motors go the motors are controlled with the single function that takes two numbers
C10,next we teach you how to make the sound turn and how to make link do something when its buttons pressed
C10,did i mention that wink is fast at point the student knows everything they to some real fun
C10,it is time a drag race close the big kids can play kids may much fun that they forget their learning serious programming language
C2,the foundation learned with wink can carry students forward in programming advanced robots and complex microprocessors
C10,the basic concepts will translate to python java and other real world programming languages
C2,we kept the cost of wink to a minimum every student can their own
C10,the lesson plans are free and open source schools workshops and events can easily be set up the wink robot is programmed with the included programming adapter
C10,wink includes a rechargeable battery and a complete automatic charging system right board plugging into the adapter and he charges automatically
C10,you can use the arduino serial print functions to debug your bug
C8,by backing project you allow us to buy parts in larger quantity to keep the cost of wink low going forward
C6,we will be able to complete the lesson plans and the intro videos
C8,rewards include wink robots you can keep your yourself share with your kids or donate to your favorite teacher
C6,we move forward we will continue to work with educators of round of world to design awesome stuff that encourages learning
C7,and speaking of awesome if you think what we are doing here is a great thing then please share campaign with a friend
C5,we designing robots in our own little shop a family the last year and it is a wonderful experience but we could not done it without the incredible community that got behind us the campaign the ringo robot
C7,we want to tell you guys how much we appreciate you and we will never forget you thank you much your time and thank you your support

C10,brs max leg attachments elite athletic training
C10,the bionic resistance shorts brs is a pair of comfortable nylon compression shorts that are laminated with neoprene strength
C10,the shorts act a stationary platform resistance bands to be attached at the legs hips and waist
C10,its purpose is to resist the movement of a users arms and legs during routine activities like walking running and exercising
C10,the brs adds resistance to a users arms legs and core simultaneously to facilitate waterlike resisted exercises land a efficient exercise
C5,three time amateur flyweight mma champion andrea kgb lee speaks about the bionic resistance shorts
C10,the brs is a fitness enthusiast and athletes dream workout gear
C10,adding resistance to most movements of a users arms and legs gives new meaning to the term working smart
C10,efficiency allows a user to burn calories quicker to she would unwanted pounds increase activity to tone and strengthen muscles much faster and increase lactate threshold to build endurance at a rapid rate
C10,the brs gives cardio a new meaning enhancing all of you favorite aerobic exercises px insanity cross fit and drills
C10,burn calories and increasing muscle activation by average of it will cut any workout time in half
C10,with the brs it is about the quality of the workout opposed to the quantity
C10,there are attachments bicep curls shoulder lateral raises triceps extensions shrugs shoulders rearfront side deltoid raises etc
C10,the brs is truly a total body workout product
C10,it is designed to be simple putting shorts and doing what you normally do
C10,made from light weight comfortable nylon laminated with neoprene the brs provides multiple benefits
C2,primarily created to provide continual resistance during the field training simulation to accelerate results it provides compression and much needed thermal retention in cold weather
C10,the compression stabilizes muscles by minimizing muscle vibrations providing efficient blood flow resulting in a efficient workout
C5,our official picture taken by the advocate news paper
C2,the bionic resistance shorts brs concept was created in by adrian cornish a former junior standout track and field athlete with a bachelors degree in biology premed who believed there was a better way to harness the power of continual resistance performance training
C2,in adrian partnered with baton rouge businessman nathan roy a graduate from lsu to form apex resistance and conditioning llc
C2,was founded to further develop test and market the breakthrough resistance training device
C9,apexs slogan is the science of movement was derived after collaborating with lsu school of kinesiology to test the effects of the brs the body
C10,efficiently designed the brs is the culmination of some of the most effective exercise equipment the market in one simple and wearable design thus making exercise efficient and convenient
C1,envision if you would being born and nurtured underwater your every motion would resistance because water is a denser medium air
C1,envision being exposed to air
C10,since your muscles are acclimated to a higher degree of continual resistance you would naturally be stronger individual who lived in air
C10,is the principal that the bionic resistance shorts operate
C10,the brs in use while swimming
C10,the major differences between the bionic resistance shorts and other resistance training apparatus is that it engages a users core upper and lower body simultaneously and simulates water like resisted exercises accelerated results
C10,another unique feature is the pure resistance factor
C10,the brs itself does not contain weights and weighs about lbs
C10,resistance is generated by the natural motion of individuals body there is no weighted pressure a users joints
C10,users can adjust resistance from lbs
C10,up to lbs legs and upwards of lbs arms by adding and subtracting resistance bands
C10,there is attachment at the rear waist belt that allows the added resistance of a parachute or sled or resisted runs
C10,some exercises illustrated with the brs
C10,the brs is over products in
C10,in short there has never a resistance training product like the bionic resistance shorts if you are not training with the brs you not reached the apex of your workout potential
C1,sometimes you to crawl before you can walk
C8,we at apex turned to kickstarter the unique opportunity it affords us to the brs into the hands of early adopters
C6,through project we hope to gain the funds necessary that those who see the value of the brs can be among the to enjoy the incredible benefits of the bionic resistance shorts
C9,through kickstarter project we hope to continue to refine and develop the brs using scientific data to maintain the cutting edge technology that is the hallmark of the bionic resistance shorts
C6,a break down of the planned usage of kickstarter funds
C7,with your help we can apex and the bionic resistance shorts off to the right start
C8,we several ways through kickstarter backer rewards that allow you to support apex and the continued development of the bionic resistance shorts
C10,the brs has a suggested msrp of
C8,through project we are offering the brs at a great early discount
C10,all brs come with instructional pamphlet including a min total body exercise routine
C8,kickstarter addons
C8,how do addons work
C8,you can add these additional items to your pledge by following the instructions below
C8,click the manage your pledge button the projects page
C8,if you not yet backed it will say back project
C8,increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the addons
C10,that would be the gloves and per set of resistance bands
C8,save your pledge
C8,do not change the tier that you originally pledged at
C8,at the end of the campaign you will receive a backer survey that will ask how you would like the addon money to be assigned
C7,stretch goals
C8,everyone who backs at the tier and up we will be adding in the brs max leg attachmentsee below to your pledge at no charge once we hit funded
C8,that is two leg attachments and leg resistance bands at no additional charge these reward tiers
C8,the brs max leg attachment
C2,we at apex are evolving the brs to make it the best product it can be
C8,that is one of the reasons kickstarter project
C10,one of the latest innovations is the brs max leg attachment
C10,the brs max leg attachment offers increased ground power and vertical strength through the use of additional attachment points and resistance bands targeting the legs
C10,allows you to even out of the bionic resistance shorts
C6,we some great stretch goals yet to be revealed and will reveal the next one once we unlocked stretch goal
C2,hey there my name is adrian cornish and i am the inventor of the bionic resistance shorts and the co founder of apex resistance and conditioning and my name is nathan roy i m co founder of apex resistance and conditioning
C2,a former athlete fitness is always a passion of mine and it is the same passion that drove me to create the concept of bionic resistance shorts back in
C2,back then i saw that there was a major flaw in traditional exercise and traditional exercise equipment
C10,and that flaw was the amount of wasted movement during exercise routine
C10,that wasted movement comes from a user spanking their arms and legs freely during exercise routine with minimal to no resistance at all
C4,tests shown that by applying a low amount of resistance to muscles while the users work they are able to capitalize off of every single movement and that exercise does enhancen of exercises
C10,some products attepted to solve problem are weight vest provide weight but not resistance the users arms and legs are still free and there is nothing resisting movement
C10,parachutes and sleds provide drag but again they do not provide resistance to a users arms and legs during movement
C10,the only traditional method that provides resistance to users upper and lower body simultaneously is a water routine
C2,since we cannot take a pool wherever we go to workout we thought we would create a product that would provide a water like resisted exercise online
C4,i met back in when i relocated to baton rouge and we worked at local funeral home and i found out that he was a fellow inventor and that is when i showed him the original prototype of the bionic resistance short
C4,it was called bionic resistance suit back then but he took a liking to the product and eventually we became business partners and quit our job and after countless prototypes and hundreds of hours of testing those prototypes here we are
C2,when adrian showed him his concept the bionic resistance suit i was blown away by the concept i could not stop thinking about it literally all night all day i was thinking about it
C2,yeah although i sidelined from athletics and fitness due to kidney failure a very long time i still had one of those why did not i think about that moment simple and effective that i could not believe that i did not think about or somebody else had thought about it yet
C2,i knew that i wanted to be part of journey with adrian i knew it would be something special
C10,the brs gives people the freedom to work out anywhere at any time without the use of cumbersome belts vines heavy equipment multiple piece of equipment it is literally over products in one
C9,lsu school of kinesiology found out the brs increases muscle activation by average of with low levels of resistant during normal things like walking running and exercising
C4,test shown that the shorts help burn over calories increase lactate threshold and cardiovascular activity with low levels of continuous resistance
C2,when we started venture we were naive we thought that higher levels of resistance made the exercise efficient but we found the opposite to be true
C10,the key is low level continuous resistance savely maximize the users body potential enhances any fitness routine
C3,during our patent phase we found that all major athletic companies like nike reebok and adidas amongst the others are in the space their focus is infusing resistance bands in the clothing but we found to be ineffective pursuit because they are still nothing resisting the motion of the arms and the legs to make a significant difference in muscular and cardiovascular activity thus adding only working pressure
C10,there is nothing like the bionic resistance shorts
C2,a testament to our mission to continue to innovate we added a new attachment point arm resistance
C10,new attachment point is located below the hip rings and provides continuous smooth resistance while walking jogging and running without compromising the stretch of the resistance bands other exercises
C10,with full range of motion and longer bassett taller individuals any exercise can be performed efficiently with added feature
C7,we your support to continue to innovate and refine the bionic resistance shorts a newstart up company we grossly underestimated the cost that is associated with bringing a brand new products to market
C2,but based the matrix we gotten back from test and the amount of athletic companies trying to create their own line of resistance clothing we know we are the cusp of something big
C7,a tool that can literally revolutionize fitness and athletic training we know it but we your help
C7,we your support in order to make reality

C10,what is the spring thing
C10,the spring thing is a selfregulating biofeedback massage device that fits in your hand
C10,what does that mean
C10,it means that you the opportunity to own a simple compact device you can keep in your purse briefcase or gym bag that will deliver relief from sore muscles in seconds
C8,it will deliver in time to give a wonderful christmas gift
C10,what makes the spring thing great
C2,we started with a perfectly contoured handle that comfortably fits in your hand
C10,the other end is a firm but not too firm rubber tip that is sized to emulate the thumb of your favorite massage therapist
C10,great these two components are the spring is what sets us apart
C4,after months of testing we selected internal spring that allows you to apply the right pressure to the desired muscular relaxation without possible added aggravation
C10,the spring tension varies based how far you compress the spring
C10,therefore you are selfregulating the pressure applied creating a biofeedback loop
C10,device influences the soft tissues to relax and let go
C10,is in contrast to other massage devices where often the harder you push the the soft tissue resists or fights against the applied pressure
C10,with spring thing you are able to apply gentle pressure to a specific point the tip is the right size to reach spots that are too small other devices
C2,how did it all begin
C2,it began with rotator cuff issues and a restricted hip flexor or you nonchiropractic nontechy types my muscles hurt
C2,i several chronic muscle pains that are difficult to stretch and relax
C2,other available devices not effective in helping me my personal trainer and i began a quest to solve challenge
C5,we tested several designs received significant feedback and what started a spring attached to a pencil evolved into what we call spring thing
C2,who is behind it
C2,we are passionate about helping others
C2,we are creative and able to bring idea to reality
C2,we are focused making project successful
C2,we are tenacious and will ensure funds and delivers
C2,we are engineer and a chiropractor with years of experience in product development business and serving others
C2,i am sold
C1,tell me
C10,it is small enough to fit in your hand light enough to carry in your purse briefcase or gym bag and affordable enough to at home in your car and at work
C10,what started answer to personal needs has turned into something we believe can benefit a large number of people who are in
C10,with a massage spring thing can help the muscle relax assist in improving joint mobility and can increase circulation
C10,with increased circulation comes better movement of lactic acid can because soreness can be the result of exercise yard work or other types of physical exertion
C10,with the spring in spring thing a person is able to quickly comfortably and gently attempt to relax muscles and tendons immediate muscle relief often within seconds
C10,is a simple application you can perform sitting standing in your car at your desk or the go and in whatever you are wearing you can apply over your clothing
C4,here are a few responses from those who tried out the prototype of spring thing
C1,do not take our word it
C5,from a patient who gets regular adjustments
C1,i a chronic neck knot that bothers me every day
C10,a few seconds with spring thing and the knot is gone
C5,from a personal trainer i could surprisingly feel the lactic acid moving and the relief was tangible
C1,i fell and tore my rotator cuff a year later i still shoulder pain every day a single application with spring thing and i could feel a major difference
C2,i like many others suffer with tight it bands and hip flexors after sitting long periods of time my muscles can be tight sore and restricted a few seconds with spring thing before standing up and i was amazed i could feel the difference when i stood up
C5,a person sitting at a computer hours or all day generally builds muscle tension in their neck and shoulders
C1,i hurt everyday from sitting at my computer at work
C5,a few seconds with spring thing and i could feel the muscle tension releasing
C1,still the fence
C1,people are shocked that something simple can make such a difference quickly them
C1,many feel muscle tension or muscle pain somewhere
C1,whether in their neck shoulders elbows wrists back hips knees or feet most people suffer with unnecessary stored muscle tension
C10,they can spring into muscle relief quickly and comfortably with spring thing nobody currently uses a spring to achieve self regulating biofeedback massage
C10,there are a lot of massage tools and devices out there and one is truly unique because of the spring
C7,is why we your help to revolutionary product out to the masses of people that can benefit from simple compact lightweight comfortable gentle and effective massage device

C2,is it ok tell us the genesis behind
C2,how start
C2,it started personal challenges i needed some help i was trying rollers and bands i massages i chiropractic adjustments and i was struggling with some specific spots my body that those other devices did not work my trainer came up with idea to use a springt to in there to point contact
C2,where you can pin point the exact spot and i got much relief that i started trying it out some patients some family and friends and the response was outrageous with different ideas that i had not thought of using it
C2,brooks actually did the engineering and the design it
C2,i think it is simple like when i saw it that cannot work
C2,you want the viewer to understand they can do it themself
C10,i do not like peope to help me
C2,feels really good because you know i tried like of these things but it is nice that you can really pin point the problem area my problem area is right there right because of my costume
C2,i am tell you that works that really feels good
C1,because like there a of other things but they are big like you know you like those vibrator things you putting your back but you really want that one spot
C10,is it gentle is it comfortable

C2,story
C10,why torch
C1,if you are raising children today you know they are screens all the timeat school with friends in the car socializing playing games doing homework
C1,and if you are like most parents you are unwilling to accept reality
C1,we do not know what they are doing and we do not know how to manage it
C2,torch exists to solve
C2,we give parents the oversight they and children the boundaries they crave
C2,because if we parents do not do our job the internet will raise our children us
C2,show the internet who is boss
C2,we are nerds and parents who struggle ourselves with balancing the creative disruption of the internet with the family disruption of screen time addiction
C2,torch was born out of jack and waynes desire to help shelley solve problem
C2,they began to help shelley they realized the best solution would be the router
C10,simple effective and powerful
C2,but then they realized existing routers suck they are hard to setup and difficult to manage
C1,and it should not require a network engineering degree to parent your children the internet
C1,make technology work your family
C10,simple powerful
C10,the torch router is both
C10,torch comes with a pause button the internet
C10,feature is profilespecific parents are able to access their devices even when the kids shut off the evening
C10,and because of how a router works torch reports your childrens actual browsing history no incognito mode or erasing history the router
C10,and when you find things in their history that you do not like you can banish sites from your home
C10,simple and easy interface
C1,most people never logged into their router to understand how convoluted it is
C1,and trying to configure parental controls top of that adds another level of confusion
C2,when we thought about designing our user interface families we knew it had to be simple and intuitive
C1,the way parents navigate torch is almost effortless that moms and dads everywhere can easily take control of their internet
C1,and it is easily controlled from our mobile parents can pause the internet with two clicks their phone
C10,stateoftheart technology
C10,shot of our preproduction production sample system boardshot of our preproduction production sample system board
C2,is the team behind torch
C2,our ceo shelley is a psychologist nationally syndicated columnist tedx speaker and mother of three digital natives
C2,the idea of torch was born from her very real struggle with digital parenting
C1,the struggle reached its tipping point one night when she became frustrated with trying to manage screen time that she threw her sons ipad out the back door
C2,after speaking with other parents she began to realize that was the new norm
C2,jack and wayne jumped in to help shelley solve her digital parenting problem
C2,jack a princetoneducated businessman had experience working with tech companies wall street
C2,a parent of two daughters he immediately empathized with shelleys plan to eliminate the tech battles families
C2,wayne a customer service innovator and tech support specialist brought a unique perspective that managing tech in your home should be simple especially busy parents
C2,the three of them grew the idea behind torch that technology should be a tool learning and growth that it should be enhancing families not diminishing them and that using it should be simple and painless
C7,join the torch nation movement
C7,if you work hard to be the best parent you can be and you are fed up that the internet gets in the way of that then you are a torch parent
C7,and we want you in our movement to help parents reclaim safety and balance in their homes making sure the time kids do spend the internet is time spent
C7,if you are ready to in the game we you to join us
C7,become part of the solution

C1,remember when playing around with blue balls was not painful
C1,or a happy ending was when a princess found her prince
C1,and when a tossed salad was a salad
C1,kids it is still that way because kids are innocent
C1,it is adults who are not and nowhere is that obvious online
C1,like things you do not want your kids to see and battles over when to turn it off
C10,that is why there is torch the better router
C10,torch makes it easy to be sure your kids are safe online and not spending too much time there

C2,i remember with my kids we had a play room when they were young
C2,and i got to choose the toy that went in there
C2,people would give them gifts and i knew exactly with what they are with
C2,i was really involved and engaged in that experience but i was very protective what went in there
C2,and with the internet we simply do not and cannot know everything that is coming into our house the only thing that really worked our solution in the way that we wanted to help parents was a router
C1,behind your router is everything in your home
C2,if you are going to try and adjust internet usage that is the point to do it
C1,all the routers out there suck
C1,when you log into a router and you see a bunch of words that you are unfamiliar with your thing is ok i do not understand and therefore they think they are going to break it
C1,it turns parents into itmanagers and that is exact opposite of what they are trying to do
C1,they are trying to away from managing devices and back to being parents
C2,the whole idea behind torches taking that vernacular and humanize it
C1,mum can pull out her phone and two taps the internet is paused the whole house
C1,should not to log into something should not to remember some ip address and some arcane password to into something it is easy changing thermostat
C1,is not about kidproofing childproofing the internet is about giving them power back to adult proof the internet from the things they do not wnat in their house
C2,because we are eleminating the to hover that we are actually fostering a little bit exploration
C2,you see your kids spending hours wikipedia reading about science biology or something
C1,all of a sudden you can go and engage with them that spot where they are really really interested and that is some really cool interaction with your kids
C1,without that information you simply do not know what you are missing you do not know the conversations that you are not having
C10,even if you bought thing and never turned the parental controls the feautures the ability to change the wifi password to turn it and off the update everything right from your phone or your website that itself is a pretty good leak forward
C1,we really want to make people feel empowered
C2,we are constantly managing either sugar or screens
C2,we can help you with the screens but with sugar you are your own

C2,if you do not read anything else page these are the things you should know about astro speaker that makes us who we are
C10,not something the same but slightly better uniquely us
C10,the rest is all the fun details
C2,we are the only bluetooth speaker that is focused pure audio
C10,all other speakers including bose and ue boom use a piece of software to change the music to better fit the format of the speaker
C10,means that the music that goes in is not the same what comes out
C2,we figured out a way using different hardware to control distortion without changing the sound
C10,pure audio what goes in comes out a full explanation see the astro allows the full range of music to be heard section
C5,what people are saying
C2,we put much thought into designing a great speaker to look at to listen to
C10,we designs to choose from from the sleek and basic black speaker to the work of art your home options designed by the famous tattoo temple art house one design only being sold during campaign and never again after
C10,details below in the tattoo temple partnership section
C10,designs to choose from
C8,we will deliver the orders by christmas
C8,we scoured kickstarter and very few projects are offering
C2,we preinvested in a limited batch run that influencers from our videos below tried out and they are ready to go soon we close
C8,if you want a combination that is not available in a current reward choose the reward add up all the items you want and send us a note letting us know what amount you pledged and what you want and we will confirm it
C2,we are not trying to be like anyone else we are trying to be the best speaker to hear music the way it was meant to be heard
C1,we know one of the questions that must make you ask is how does listening to pure audio compare to what i know today
C1,you will see and hear a lot of comparisons in social media to the brands below and we want to set the record straight
C2,we are not trying to be better at bass or a bigger sound though astro is good at both
C2,we are trying to help you appreciate the full range of the song
C7,your project funded today
C10,below is our own honest selfevaluation off how we compare to the leading portable speakers
C5,a nonbiased review of how we compare in sound
C1,and those technically curiousan explanation of what makes it different
C1,the bass the best reference the amount of bass astro has go check the ue boom in stores everywhere
C10,it is really the closest the market that we can refer to
C10,the bose mini soundlink and jbl charge the most bass the mass market around hz compared to our hz
C2,we did not want to design a speaker where bass would overpower everything else
C2,we wanted bass mid and highs to be balanced astro to offer alternative to what the market is offering
C5,boses portable speaker won pc mags editors choice award portable speakers was reviewed with the following statement
C10,they a long way to go before audiophiles and purists hop onboard
C10,midhigh is really where we shine
C10,we do not control the signal with dsp in order to manage distortion
C10,we used good quality hardware and design to handle the distortion
C10,dsp we do not use dsp
C10,bose is really using dsp the most and the most professional with it
C10,adjust the sound to fit the speaker to reduce distortion
C10,the drivers the bose are mm wide ours are mm wide
C10,bose uses complex dsp that basically adjust the frequencies or even removes some of them your song is playing in order to fit the speaker and reduce the distortion
C10,is especially true the mid and highs if you pay attention feels flat and very controlled the bose
C10,it has a quite impressive piece of software
C7,and that is astro please do email us astrokickstartergmailcom or throw a comment our page if you want to talk about any of the points above
C2,we believe in them we stand behind them and are passionate about them
C10,the rest below are the details you to spend your hard earned money our project
C2,but we promise you that if you do you will one of the best musiclistening experiences possible out of a speaker at size and price
C10,the rest

C10,even the best portable speakers do it

C7,find out at mrktstorecom
C2,we working in the audio industry a very long time specifically in the product development and manufacturing segment
C2,we got started working in the wireless segment when bluetooth was starting to be interesting in the audio environment and worked products different brands and retailers
C2,we quickly realized that many manufacturer and brands were not audio guys but electronics products developers and that audio quality was a secondary requirement andor not something they were capable of developing
C2,we saw that because they did not the experience they were relying a lot software to a good sound
C2,astro is really the conclusion of all our years developing products others about years collectively and our own passion to sound and design
C2,if we were to give a clear line of where the astro is coming from it would be about years ago when we started working a solution that would be the best we could do
C2,we completed a full solution something that works and can be released then were not completely happy with it then did another round of development to improve the then another and learning about all that could be done and pushing things to their limits we went
C2,today astro is really a current culmination of what we learned and what we tried to achieve years ago and finally our own design sensibilities without the constraint and requirements of our customers
C2,and of course once astro is released we will keep pushing the envelope
C2,we are leveraging kickstarter that we can focus the design that pure audio enthusiasts care about instead of the design that comes from the costcutting demands of retailers
C7,to do and to help bring the best pure audio speaker to you we help funding the initial materials and manufacturing costs astro
C2,that is why we are coming to you
C9,bose is a registered trademark of bose corp of framingham massachusetts
C4,no claims verified by independent testing laboratory
C2,hi we are treelab the audio geeks behind astro
C10,the only true pure audio portable speaker
C2,we do not make the music fit the speaker we rather make the speaker fit the music
C6,i start company because i m a musician and i being in the audio business years
C2,when i listen a song from the artist i want to hear all the little details that the artist puts into his song and a piano player myself i don t want to hear the base
C2,we partnered up to start a pure audio movement alexis is the hardware genious and i worked to make it look great in your home
C5,we know there is already a community of pure audio lovers but we want to take it one step further into portable listening
C2,we used our experience in audio enginerring to develop hardware that will fit the music instead of using software to distort it
C6,our goal was to replicate the techniques that used thousand dollar systems and at the same time without a doubt the best value in portable speakers the market today
C7,do not believe us
C7,listen yourself
C10,you can see that even the best speaker in the market today has a long way to go to create a pure audio product
C10,they are really focused base and volume
C10,they changed the song to fit the speaker
C10,astro built a speaker to fit the song
C10,to the desired sound using software it has simple turning a button in seconds
C4,every adjustment made to astros sound it require new parts and retesting takes weeks
C2,the astro team invested in the state of the art sound lab
C2,in house manufacturing and design

C10,right from the off when you actually look at the page of the astra speaker the company makes it pretty clear that they are not about the bass and that their speak about a pure audio experience
C10,having said that though the bases is still really substantial it has powerful competing speakers the inner take mars box example a speaker i rated really really highly and audio clarity it has a whole new level
C10,it is really really transparent you can hear a lot of stuff going in your music
C10,the miracous in the background the strumm of a guitar the material of the drum kit it has all slight details like that really start to separate from a similarly priced competitors
C2,i was shocked to hear that the astro speakers sound significantly better
C10,it gets much louder does not destroy max volume and the overall sound is much richer and fuller
C2,one of the best bluetooth speakers i heard
C10,it has stupid loud sounds crystal clear
C10,highs and lows and everything in between is very very pronounced and very good there is nothing muffling any of that sound is very pure and very truetolife
C10,that soundquality is super point i really clear and clean audio voice and clean base and it has really loud
C10,i could really fill up a room with sound with no problem
C10,it has a pleasure enjoying listening to it and if you really like to listen to audio you really enjoy audio i defenetly recommend you
C7,check in out at least the side
C5,i highly recommend speaker even over the criticallyacclaimed bose soundlink and ue boom
C10,instruments and voice really do sound pure and a bit different most other speakers
C5,the sound is better any speaker i ever ownd in my life my entire life
C10,pure audio yes it does sound very clean
C10,it does not distort it has very pleasing to bite listen to and to look
C5,is not disappointed is the best speaker i heard yet
C5,to and i the bose soundlink mini right and sounds better it
C10,the audio was super clear and vocals are awesome
C10,there is no affordable speaker the planet with better sound
C5,i do not care if you looking at bose i do not care if you looking at beats
C10,none of them compare to how awesome thing is
C5,what is up guys matt moon is here
C5,the other day i did a review the astro pure audio bluetooth speakers
C10,is a brand new speaker that was launched kickstarter and i found the sound to be absolutely awesome but the big question that i got in the comment section was how does it sound compared to the bose soundlink mini
C10,other people feel that the sound link mini has one of the best sound the market
C2,i thought it would be a great idea to do a sound comparison between astro pure audio bluetooth speaker and the soundlink mini
C2,i am throw in the ue boom another reference point and want you guys to remember that test is not going to give you a true example of how the speaker sound if you were standing and listening to them right in front of you
C10,you to remember my microphone is going to interpret the sound differently and the speakers that you play at back use different sound drivers and will change the way it actually sounds
C5,test will give you a good idea speakers sounds the best let us started
C2,here are my closing thoughts
C2,i am going to start with the ue boom because i felt it came in third place
C2,it has good sound and i think it has the perfect speaker if you are looking something to take outdoors and you want something waterproof next up came the bose soundlink mini
C2,it had great sound and has the best base out of all three speakers but i found the base to be a little bit overbearing and it kind took over the mids and the heighs of the speaker itself
C10,and finally the astra pure audio speaker one is definitely the best out of the bunch
C10,it had balanced base it did not deep the bose but it still sounded great
C10,top of that the highs were nice and clear and the overall sound was very rich compared to the other two
C2,me i am definitely going to choose the astro speaker but i want to know what you guys think in the comments below
C7,let me know one you guys think has the best sound and if you going to pick one up or if you one already let me know what you like and dislike like about it
C7,always thank you much watching video
C7,if you found it helpful or you really enjoyed it smash that like button if you do it to the channel feel free to subscribe and always i will see you in the next video
C1,when you listen to music you want to feel like you are right there in the room with your favourite musicians
C1,and that is what it should sound like
C1,that is what makes music wonderful all the many layers that work together to make a rich and textured song however music listening has moved from home speakers to portable speakers technology has not kept up
C1,today many of these layers are removed to avoid distortion inside a smaller speaker formats
C1,every portable speaker manufacturer uses a piece of software to help create a big sound in a small format
C1,software flatens the music increases the base and removes most of the sonic layers that define a true listening experience
C2,bothered us because we live music but it inspired us to do something about it
C10,incredibly useful multitool that is where you it when you it
C10,but will it really fit in my wallet
C10,yes wildcard is the height of one credit card and the thickness of two
C10,is the blade actually sharp
C1,yes it has built to tackle lifes everyday tasks both big and small
C10,no box cutter no problem
C10,what if i forget it in my wallet and go through airport security
C10,pop off the blade and discard it rather sacrificing the whole tool
C10,you can a replacement after your trip
C10,what else can it do
C10,wildcard is not a onetrick pony it has a multifunctional wolf
C1,you can finally rid of that clunky keychain opener
C1,and adjust screws whenever you to
C2,the story behind wildcard
C2,cellphone wallet keys is the checklist i run through before leaving the house
C2,with phones getting bigger space in my pocket is at a premium
C1,even if i could remember to carry a multitool everyday its pocket bulk would outweigh its convenience
C2,drove me to create the wildcard a bladed multitool to minimize space and maximize utility
C1,being prepared should not be a burden
C10,place wildcard in your wallet once and always it handy
C10,how do you fit a multitool with a blade in your wallet
C2,i wanted something i would not forget something i would not lose and something that would take up little space possible
C2,i had already successfully kickstarted pocketmonkey a mmthin bladeless multitool that fits in your wallet
C2,inspired me to create a pocket knife in the same form
C2,i constrained myself to keep the design to two pocketmonkeys thick
C10,easy right
C2,i decided to reimagine the pocketknife without pins rivets or complex assemblies
C10,all of these add cost and thickness to the tool
C2,i designed and redesigned and redesigned a proprietary new pivot system the blade that would let it stay under mm
C2,in the end i spent two years designing a rigid pivot with a removable blade that met my thinness goal
C2,but it is finally ready and we are a few short steps away from production
C10,innovative design
C3,unique design is patent pending
C10,there is nothing that stands above the mm height limit
C10,the proprietary flyoff pivot enables you to remove the blade quickly easily and without tools
C1,if you forget you wildcard in your wallet at airport security you can simply surrender the blade and order a replacement later
C10,two things you are never supposed to use your blade are prying things apart and turning screws these features are built into the handle
C10,of course it would not be a zootility tools design without a bottle opener is subtly integrated into the wolf cutout
C10,all of these features are integrated into a fullyhardened stainless steel construction creating a rigid and safe knife with a solid feel and exceptional durability
C10,wildcard will not break or rust
C8,you launched some successful kickstarter projects already why do you funding
C2,we committed to producing all of our products in the us
C2,we want to reinvigorate american manufacturing
C2,but we can only do that if our products can actually be made at scale
C2,wildcard is too expensive to produce at scale with our current equipment
C7,we the funding a downpayment new manufacturing tools that will allow us to reduce costs and make wildcard a commercial reality
C7,is where we still help
C10,it is possible to make highquality very highend products in the us by passing the production costs to the consumer
C1,there will always be a small group of people willing to pay top dollar americanmade quality
C2,but we want to make quality products everybody
C2,in our experience producing affordable product in the us requires doing much of the work inhouse possible
C10,means making big investments in manufacturing equipment and space
C7,and is where crowdfunders like you come in
C7,you can reverse the current trends and make a difference
C1,there should not be high barriers to support american manufacturing
C7,help us pave a new path ingenuity in design handson manufacturing selfdistribution quality products with competitive pricing
C2,we know it is doable because we are currently doing it with our other products
C7,we your help to make it happen again with wildcard
C10,what is the wildcard ks edition
C10,wildcard ks edition
C8,the ks edition is a way us to thank our backers
C8,it is a limited edition kickstarteronly release
C10,the laser engraving the ks edition is extremely complex and timeconsuming process
C10,you probably never seen anything like because other companies are not crazy enough to commit the time needed to manufacture such detailed artwork with such a highquality process
C10,each ks edition literally takes minutes to laser engrave with a w laser
C10,the marking has ultrapremium look made from a carbon buildup under the surface of the metal
C10,it is indelible and will not wear off
C10,but do not take our work it
C4,wildcard prototype
C5,here are a few sites that tested andor reviewed the wildcard
C5,press
C2,hey i am nate bar creator of the pocket monkey here today to tell you about my latest creation wildcard
C1,the pocketknife needs to evolve
C10,it is essential tool but it is bulky it is one thing to remember in the morning and it easily falls your pocket and is lost
C2,i wanted something better i asked why not put a pocket knife in my wallet to be easier to carry it harder to lose
C2,i set out to design a knife that be thin possible and the result is wildcard
C10,it is only mm thick only slightly thicker a credit card
C2,i was able to do by reimagining the blade pivot
C10,most knives a pin press through a whole
C10,wild car has a pivot unlike anything in the world
C10,i call it fly off technology
C10,the three wings of the pivot allow the knife blade to remain ridgid to the body a necessity when wielding a sharp tool
C10,safety i designed the blade to lock open and to lock closed
C10,the blade tux neatly under two blades guards and it angles only one side users cannot accidentally cut themselves when carrying a close knife
C10,and heres the best part about design the blade is detachable
C2,i designed with the forgetful traveler in mind
C10,when you go through tsa with your traditional knife you you lose your knife
C10,but with wildcard you only lose your blade and our website you can replace it only a few dollars
C2,with pocketmonkey i used a monkey to represent the personality of the tool
C2,with wildcard i kept that trend going
C10,wild card has a wolf cut out that doubles a bottle opener
C10,the wolf embodies is the nature of the tool agile yet powerful
C2,i wanted to pack much functionality possible into wildcard
C1,many people misuse knives in place of other tools like screwdrivers and pry bars harming themselves of breaking their knives
C2,i added these tools to the knife
C2,i always wanted to challenge convention
C2,because of that i spent the last six months trying to reinvent how product is manufactured
C2,every manufacturer i talked with was hesitant to produce such aggressive design
C2,the solution i kept hearing was take to china but that is not something i am willing to do
C2,i want to create products that embody the american spirit of innovation and my solution was to create a manufacturing facility in maine
C5,we control every aspect of production from laser cutting to packaging and shipping we can manufacture the highest quality product while creating jobs in our community
C7,help us make wild card a reality and help us continue the american spirit of innovation

C5,partnership
C1,our popular culture reinforces the idea that what you buy at the liquor store is what you and that there is no way to make it your own
C1,and in order to the really tasty stuff the stuff aged years or decades you must be ready to dish out the big bucks every time
C10,it is time someone changed that
C2,that is why we created the oak bottle
C10,the oak bottle is the forhomeuse barrelaging vessel
C1,anyone can take average bottle of wine or whiskey to new heights or bring out new flavors in your best bottle
C7,read and watch below
C2,i am joel paglione creator of the worlds fastest oak aging vessel the oak bottle
C2,my immersion into the winemaking culture stems from my italian roots
C2,every fall my family looks forward to making wine and there is stiff competition among my uncles to see who can create the best bottle
C2,seven years ago one of my uncles was diagnosed with cancer led him to build the greatest legacy
C2,he bought a vineyard and converted it into a winery and named it paglione estate winery
C2,my uncle had a successful construction business and decided he would put construction hold and go into something he was even passionate about
C2,he passed three months ago and left a beautiful legacy
C2,before he passed i would go to the winery and we would walk through it and i would ask why we use many small barrels
C2,why not put the wine bigger barrels to save time processing
C2,he said to me the words that would change the course of my life what you do not understand joel is the smaller the barrel the faster the oak infusion
C10,the paglione estate winery is located in ontario canada and the cold weather can make growing crops a challenge
C10,accelerating the aging process with small barrels is a useful method in coldclimate wine areas like canada where significant grape loss can occur in any given year
C10,some wineries use even smaller oak barrels to aid in getting the wine to taste like aged wine that is aged years in a shorter amount of time
C10,downsized barrels about half the size of the gallon barrels you might find in california allow wine from the abundant years to be bottled sooner and put shelves quickly
C2,that realization led me to begin developing my chicagobased oak bottle four years ago
C10,after multiple iterations oak bottle was debuted in march at the international housewares show and was awarded the invention recognition award of the entire show
C10,the oak bottle makes it possible the regular person to oak age their favorite wines and spirits whereas in the past only wineries and distilleries had access to the oak barrel
C2,our approach is similar to sodastream
C10,it used to be only big soda makers had access to carbonation machines and sodastream brought carbonation to the consumer
C2,that is a similar path we are
C1,the inexperienced can figure out their taste preferences and the experts can impress their friends
C2,with the oak bottle we are trailblazing a whole new category
C2,our company is passionate about making the aging process simple fast and cost effective everyone
C2,our mission is to pioneer the world of custom aged wine spirits beer and cocktails that everyone can enjoy the taste of that expensive vintage or that top shelf whiskey but at a price point they can afford
C2,we think everyone should access to traditional barrel aging techniques but in the palm of their hand and in the comfort of their own home
C10,the oak bottle is aging vessel that is designed to allow anyone to customize their favorite beverages with extravagant aromas and complex oak aged flavor
C10,enjoying fantastic oaked wine or whiskey has never easier or inexpensive
C10,using our oak bottle you can produce the same oak flavors that once took years to infuse but in hours or days
C3,the solution is our patent pending design maximizes the amount of oak surface area that the liquid inside is in contact with thereby accelerating the oak aging process naturally
C10,unlike oak chips oak spirals and oak barrels the oak bottle works in little to hours and it is extremely simple to use

C10,each lux oak bottle requires hour to be fully laser etched and comes in multiple d etched patterns
C8,to upgrade your current oak bottle reward to lux version add to your pledge amount
C9,while oak bottle is designed to be beautiful with seamless elegance its real achievement is attributed to the science and math that allows it to work
C9,we stated earlier the oak bottle works by utilizing a simple mathematical equation
C10,surface area divided by volume
C10,essentially the surface area that touches less volume the faster the oak infusion process happens
C10,it is that simple
C9,we done the math and our bottle is mathematically times faster a typical oak barrel
C10,oak barrel essentially does two things
C10,it allows a very slow introduction of oxygen into the wine or spirit aka microoxygenation and it imparts the character of the wood into the wine through surface contact absorption and extraction
C10,due to the large surface area to volume ratio of the oak bottle the rate at the wine or spirit absorbs and extracts from the charred oak surface inside the quicker the maturation process occurs
C10,we designed the oak bottle to be taller it is wide unlike a barrel that we can maximize the liquid contact inside and to ensure the liquid in the center has the most opportunity to contact the inside walls
C10,the oak bottle is made from one single consistent piece of oak opposed to barrels are made from multiple staves of wood
C10,means better consistency and quality of oak flavor
C10,until there were only three ways to oak age wine or spirits oak barrels oak spirals or oak chips
C10,but none are effective the oak bottle
C10,oak barrels casks we said oak barrels and casks are expensive bulky difficult to transport they leak cannot be poured from require rotating often and most of all they are extremely slow at oak aging due to their volumetosurfacearearatio
C10,oak chips although oak chips are inexpensive and relatively simple way to add oak flavor to wine or spirits they displace valuable volume and leave sediment in the alcohol requires heavy filtering to remove
C10,a major flaw is the inability to allow microoxygenation is a huge part of how the oak aging process works
C10,it is not about adding oak flavor to wine or spirits
C10,some may say that without microoxygenation using oak chips is like adding oak extract into your wine or spirit
C10,oak spirals staves or sticks the problem with oak spirals staves and sticks is primarily that they take weeks to impart any true oak flavor into the wine or spirit
C10,and although they do not add much sediment oak chips sediment is still issue
C10,and they displace liquid and we all know volume is money
C10,fishing the sticks out of the vessel can be a pain
C10,most importantly like oak chips there is no microoxygenation breathing through the wood occurring with oak spirals a critical part of the oak aging process
C10,putting the alternatives to the ultimate test
C10,in order to prove that the oak bottle is faster at oak aging all the alternatives we set up a gopro camera and conducted experiment putting all modern oak aging methods head to head with the oak bottle and filmed it over a hour period in time lapse
C10,see the results yourself below
C10,the results of the below time lapse video will shock you click below
C10,it is clear you can see in the video and the results below the oak bottle aged batch is clearly oak aged any of the other methods
C10,it is color is amber it is vanilla notes are firmly enriched in the nose and it is taste is layered with complexity roundness and sweetness
C10,it is undeniable that the oak bottle is by far effective at oak aging other modern oak aging methods available today
C10,trends in aging whiskey and other spirits are the rise and the oak bottle is excited to be the effective household tool to tackle the market
C9,technomic inc wwwtechnomiccom the leading food research and consulting firm noted in a recent press release the growing popularity of signature cocktails
C10,barrel aged cocktails in particular are picking up steam in bars and lounges worldwide and the oak bottles conveniently portable size reusability and quick turnaround time is helping to blaze the way
C10,size does matter one of the major obstacles bartenders are facing when it comes to barrel aged cocktails is that most barrels are simply too big to make sense a bar in most cases limited capacity or shelf space
C10,barrels can range anywhere from gallon to gallons is practical if you are a large spirit or wine producer and are bottling hundreds of cases of bottles but not a bar or restaurant where space is limited
C10,not only is there the issue of space constraints but even important is the issue of the amount of time required barrels and casks to adequately age anything
C1,bartenders simple do not time to wait months their cocktails to be ready
C1,they want to experiment quickly and change menus often without investing in gallons of alcohol or months of their time to see if their recipe will even turn out tasting good enough to offer up
C1,bartenders are putting it to use some of the best bars in the world are using the oak bottle a tool to create a barrel aged cocktail program that is unlike anything before
C10,two of the top bartenders in the world james estes and claudiu mnerau recently won the diageo reserve world class uae competition heat using the oak bottle their final judged cocktails the brown diamond and the second barrel are both featured recipes in our cocktail recipe book aged available exclusively our kickstarter supporters
C1,and other globally recognized bartenders and sommeliers are calling it the next must wine spirit and bar accessory
C7,check out the testimonials in the video below
C10,the oak bottle can make inexpensive wine or spirits taste good if not better the expensive stuff
C4,but do not believe us we taken our bottle to the streets of chicago to random people taste test
C4,blind taste test we decided to put the oak bottle to the test to prove that we can make inexpensive wine and whisky taste good if not better the expensive award winning option
C10,we selected red wines and whiskeys made from the same varieties but different price points
C4,eight random strangers off the street tasted and rated each of the wines and whiskies
C7,check out the blind taste test video below
C10,results according to the tasters the oak bottle aged wine and whiskey was noticeably smoother and easier to sip
C10,the total scores from the random strangers the oak bottle aged wine and whiskey was way above the most expensive options
C10,if you are contemplating that expensive bottle of red wine or that top shelf whiskey perhaps yourself oak bottle instead
C10,the thing you will want to do when preparing the oak bottle use is to swell it by adding lukewarm water to the bottle and let it sit to the bottle sealed and ready its batch of aging
C10,once the bottle has stopped leaking could take hours or let the water out and air dry without letting it completely dry out again
C10,once the bottle is rid of water add the wine spirit beer or cocktail of your choice
C10,after filling the oak bottle with your beverage of choice let it sit undisturbed in a dry area out of direct sunlight to hours or until your preferred level of oak aged flavor and aroma is reached
C10,that is it
C10,kick back and enjoy your masterpiece
C2,we developing the oak bottle over years
C2,it took us five iterations of the design to us to the point of being ready with our production bottle
C5,we had a few hundred of the oak bottle made and handed them out to family friends and industry experts
C5,people loved what the oak bottle could do but it was too bulky looking
C2,we redesigned the bottle to a narrow shape and compensated it by increasing its height we did not lose volume
C2,we changed the shape of the neck to be a gradual curve reminiscent of of a wine bottle and called it the oak bottle
C2,we are proud of the oak bottle but the product could be even better
C7,with your help we can make the oak bottle production friendly that we can improve our throughput and reduce costs

C10,and the idea was revolutionary
C10,let us create the most practical most exquisite and the most efficient oak aging vessel earth
C10,introducing the oak bottle the fastest occasion vessel ever made

C2,it was here he learnt that the smaller the oak barrel the quick it was to achieve that ideal oak character
C2,yet there was no cost effective small sized options available that would be practical the home enthusiast
C2,revelation spurred him to develop the smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made
C2,i was walking into the family winery one night and i asked my uncle why do we put our vine in such small barrels why do not we put it all in one big barrel
C2,it would save alot of time processing wine
C2,he said what you do not understand joel is the smaller the barrel the faster the oak infusion
C2,and that is when the idea of the oak bottle was born
C1,wine and spirit enthusiast are putting it to use by taking cheap or average tasting options and elevating them to palate pleasing levels
C10,the sleek vessel works aging accelerator adding subtle caramel notes smoothness and other oak traits to the liquid it holds
C10,each oak bottle is made from percent american white oak that is handcrafted and charred like the classic barrel
C10,the oak bottle puts the power of customization and experimentation in the palm of your hand affordably allows you to age young wine or spirit into one ripe with body and character but in a few ours or days
C7,with your help we can continue to pioneer the world of customaged wine and spirits
C10,the oak bottle it is time
C10,the secret behind the oak bottle speed at oak aging is it surface area to volume ratio
C10,it is simple oak vessel with surface area touching less volume can infuse the wine or spirit quicker
C10,is the up bottle really faster at oak aging anything the market
C4,we tested against all modern oak aging methods and filmed it a h period
C7,you be the judge
C2,we took aged blanco tequila and aged different ways starting with our mini oak bottle then our master oak bottle a l oak cask oak spiral and finally oak chips
C2,then we set the clock hours and let them all sit untouched overnight
C2,hours later we poured each into separate containers and compared them colour aroma and taste
C2,it is clear in hours the oak bottles tequila is by far noticeably aged and looks like a neotequilla blanco
C2,we reset the clock another hours and let them all sit again untouched overnight to continue aging
C2,hours from when we started the experiment we poured each out a final time to compare the results
C10,the oak bottle aged badges clearly oak aged any of the other methods
C10,its colour is a rich amber
C10,it is vanilla notes are firmly and rich in the nose and it is taste is layered with complexity roundness and sweetness
C10,it is clear to see and undeniable that the oak bottle is by far effective at oak aging anyother modern oak aging method available today
C10,with challenge you to conduct your own h test and be sure to send us your photos or oakbottle
C1,trends in aging whiskey and other spirits are the rise and the oak bottle is excited to be the effective household tool to tacle the market
C1,technomic inc
C9,the leading foodresearch and consulting firm noted in a recent press release the growing popularity of signature cocktails
C1,barrel aged cocktails in particular are picking up steam and bars and loungeries worldwide
C10,oak bottles conviniently portable size reusability and quick turnaround time is helping to blaze the way
C5,recently two of the top bartenders james estes and claudiu mnerau worldclass heat while utilising the oak bottle and other globally recognised bartenders and somiliers are calling it the next must wine spirit and bar accessory
C2,here we aim nothing but perfection
C2,we are constantly developing and innovating ourselves that is why we are very specific when we choose our tools to do
C2,one of the tools that we use is the oak bottle if it is used properly it can help you create new and unique ingredients add layers flavours and help you give your guest a unique experience
C2,i love the oak bottle because by the time it took to make video i allready successfully aged another batch in my brown diamond cocktail
C2,from my point of view the whole process is much faster
C2,the oakbottle we had a opportunity to test that out a radio show and it is a proofen fact that it works
C10,it took a bottle of sufisant wine and turned it into a premium bottle of wine
C2,i using the oak bottles it is amazing product great results and great value money
C2,realy like a must anyone who is planning to age cocktails
C2,we decided to put the oak bottle to the test
C2,we see if we can make cheap wine and whiskey taste good if not better the expensive awardwinning option
C2,we aged the same red wine hours in oak bottle and aged red label whiskey in oak bottle hours
C5,i felt b had a little smokier taste to it
C5,smokey it was warmer
C10,the oakbottle was able to improve the yellow tail merlot by points and able to improve the red label whiskey by points
C1,next time you contemplate that expensive bottle of red wine or that popshop whiskey
C7,yourself oakbottle instead
C1,becoming a seasoned winemaker or experimental spirit distillery is closer you may think with the help of the home use barrel aging apparatus the oak bottle
C10,similar to using barrel it must be filled or bathed with water to let the wood swell and seal itself
C10,then it is ready to be filled with either a wine or liquor and left to age anywhere to hours
C10,with the oak bottle it is easier to transform the ordinary into something extraordinary
C8,with the help of kickstarter the oakbottle
C10,optimized cork length and weight strong ceiling but easy removal
C10,it will include a custom laser etched cork top diameter with improved dimensional variation
C10,finely crafted flawless stainless steel rings
C10,a steel ring offset with improved positioning and flash miss dimensional variation

C7,create your own galaxy of light
C10,our spinning orbit combines four stunning led microlights and a breathtaking array of colors brightness levels and display modes
C2,with over eight years of experience in the led microlight industry we expanded the possibilities of orbit light shows once again by building our most ambitious orbit ever
C4,functional prototype with handles
C10,sealed in a durable easyaccess frosted casing two of the orbit arms are elongated to create a unique second ring of light
C10,double ring effect
C10,simply click your orbit and choose one of dazzling color modes
C10,spin it to music and your orbit adds a new dimension to your experience you make the lights follow spiral out from and crash into the beat
C10,each galaxy orbit includes independently programmable microlights brilliant colors and brightness levels per color giving you maximum flexibility to customize any light show you desire
C4,galaxy orbit prototype with galaxy chips
C7,enjoy orbiting your own take it to a party or use it anywhere dark that needs a light show
C5,team up with your friends and spin your galaxies to build a whole universe of light together
C1,if you are a pro galaxy gives you everything you and and if you are new to orbits start with the best it is easy to learn and fun
C10,light painting with galaxy orbit
C10,orbiting is the art of manipulating light to create awesome display of colors in motion
C10,controlled by a series of leds bound together and strung through the center the idea is to twist and spin the orbit to produce rings of bright colorful light
C10,by varying the speed of your spin and matching it to the beat of music the lights open and close blend together and dance in perfect harmony giving you and anyone watching incredible light show
C1,a lightup yoyo allows a fleeting moment of pleasure before you to retract it while orbits dualhanded operation gives you far control and you never to stop spinning
C10,orbiting is easy the best way to learn is to simply pick one up and play with it
C7,check out our howto video the basics and when you want to learn there are thousands of videos of orbits in action youtube
C10,advanced moves and tricks come naturally with practice most orbiters develop their own style and moves in a few weeks
C10,orbiting in easy steps
C10,step the most important part of orbiting is what comes naturally when you take the handles in your hands you wind it up
C10,the tension the strings makes the orbital in the middle spin rapidly
C10,step you want to build tension the strings while bringing your hands together and then slowly pulling them apart
C10,avoid any sudden moves can because your orbit to stop spinning
C10,you slowly pull your hands apart you increase the speed of the orbital in the middle then produces the awesome rings you want to see
C10,step soon you will find that a slight flick of the strings produces different shapes
C10,in the end practice makes perfect
C10,play with your orbit and and your skills will improve and you will be able to come up with your own style and moves
C2,in we launched the very official online store dedicated to led orbits
C2,we built our orbits with keychain lights a satin cord and cable ties zipties from the local hardware store
C2,over time we were sending ziptie orbits all around the world but despite their popularity we knew we could do better
C3,in we invented the orbitadapter our patented plastic carrier that made it a snap to secure led lights in place
C10,today orbitlightshowcom features all kinds of led products and over different orbits come in multiple colors and mode combinations
C2,we truly inspired to watch orbiting evolve from its diy origins to a fullfledged craft
C2,orbiters break out new and crazier tricks everyday we think you deserve a better device to help you perform the ultimate light show
C10,if you are interested in learning how to orbit right before the end of campaign we a high quality beginner orbital features our orbitadapter above light rainbow orbit
C2,we knew everything we wanted to accomplish with the galaxy provide all the features modes and colors you would
C10,design a smooth rounded secure holder that is easy to access and make it frosted the light can refract through it when it spins
C2,we got further into development we realized that all orbits one thing in common when you spin them they produce one ring
C10,the colors and patterns differ within the ring but they are confined to a single circle effect
C4,d render of our latest prototype
C2,with the galaxy orbit we designed two longer and two shorter arms
C10,gives you inner orbit and outer orbit adds a completely new and exciting element to your lightshows
C4,we spent a lot of time testing and retooling to achieve the perfect aerodynamics our exclusive saturn effect and we know you are going to love it
C10,all of your modes colors and brightness levels can be programmed via the galaxy chips embedded with your rgb led microlights
C10,the memory function ensures that even when you to change batteries all your favorite configurations are saved
C10,arclite galaxy chip led bulb will be diffused in final version
C10,there are dazzling display modes color sandbox mode courtesy of our friends over at futuristic lights hyper strobe ribbon tracer dots dash dot threecolor slow fade rainbow strobe rainbow ribbon and a demo mode cycles through each mode every seven seconds
C10,simply click the lights and each click moves you to the next mode
C10,press and hold second and release any mode to turn off
C10,press and hold any mode seconds to enter color programming
C10,here are some long exposure photos of the programmable modes using the red green and blue color options
C10,hyper strobe
C10,ribbon
C10,tracer
C10,dots
C10,fade
C10,because each chip the galaxy orbit can be programmed independently and each individual color has a low medium or high option you can extremely creative with literally unlimited possibilites
C10,the galaxy chip features different colors and a blank color option you can add spaces between your colors to create new visuals
C10,each color can be set to low medium or high brightness
C10,by the way is not a regular keychain light that you pick up at the store
C10,our chips are made using highintensity rgb leds and pin flash microcontroller with nanowatt xlp technology picf
C10,the design is based our led glove set chips you can use the galaxy chip with glove sets too
C10,the best way to to know your new orbit is in its default settings and you can a lot of fun in rgb
C7,when you are ready to move and program the modes and colors please see our howto video below
C10,in addition to setting colors each mode you can use master color programming to create one set of your favorite colors to use across all modes
C10,if you ever want to wipe the chip clean and start over you can master reset back to the default rgb colors
C10,each galaxy orbit includes two cr battery per chip
C10,is a standard battery that will last several months depending use is inexpensive to replace and easy to find
C10,to access the batteries all you is a screwdriver to loosen the two screws that hold your orbit case together
C10,your orbit includes two hole handles to make orbiting comfortable
C10,some users may not even the handles while others may want to move up to our softer neoprene version
C8,we are here kickstarter ready to go into production with your backing and deliver the ultimate orbit to you your reward
C4,all development work is complete we tested multiple prototypes to everything right and we can start production immediately upon funding
C7,all we is your support to meet the minimum order requirements and in a couple months the galaxy orbit will be in your hands
C6,we seen the benefits of spreading happiness through positive nonverbal interactions that go beyond words and we cannot wait to see you share your light your moves and your creativity everywhere with your galaxy orbit

C10,your galaxy orbit includes display modes and each mode is customisable with colours a blank colour option and three brightness levels to choose from
C10,you can programm up to colors of your choice per mode
C10,each with their own level of brightness
C10,to begin power the light you want to programm and click through untill you find the mode you want to customize
C2,example we are going to work with ribbon mode
C10,click untill the light flashes low power blue and release the button
C10,you are in color programming
C10,from blue each click takes you through the color options you can use our color chart a guide you idea where your color is will come up you click through
C2,we are going to programm blush tangerine and nebula
C10,we click untill we find blush and then we press and hold to cycle through high medium and low brightness
C10,we release high brightness and the light will flash and return to blue programming mode
C10,you set your color
C10,let us continue click through the colors untill we to tangerine
C10,time we will press and hold medium brightness
C10,release the light flashes and we are back to blue
C10,one time let us click trough to nebula
C10,press and hold low brightness release flashes back to blue
C10,you can select up to colors but we are ready to finish
C10,click and hold the low power blue
C10,the light quickly powers off and powers back
C10,and you will see your mode with the newly programmed colors
C10,repeat these steps to programm up to colors with different brightnesses all nine of your modes or you can move to the next chip to create unique visuals all four of your microlights
C10,even when you removing the batteries our galaxy chip will remember your programmed colors
C7,the only thing you to do is to keep playing until your meet you perfect set
C9,million people play minecraft and most of them are preteens
C1,do you know who your child is playing minecraft with
C1,no you do not
C10,and that is why having a mineserverTM is important because it makes the game even better while keeping out the pervs
C10,minecraft from mojang microsoft is a clientserver sandbox game that allows children and adults to build things and then blow them up
C1,you cannot play true minecraft without connecting to a server
C9,there are thousands of minecraft servers the internet but most of them are in some way commercial typically adbased
C1,that means advertising to your children
C9,while every minecraft server technically has admin some do a better job of policing the fun others
C9,cyberbullying servers is common
C9,the textbased chat in minecraft can easily out of hand when players are in survival mode generally devolves from building to fighting
C9,a big commercial minecraft server can thousands of simultaneous players and if you are a parent there is no way of knowing who is that knave with the diamond sword killing your child and stealing his or her stuff
C7,but there is a better way run your own adfree minecraft server
C10,all it takes is old pc or the server can run in background dad or moms pc
C9,multiplayer server software is free from microsoft
C1,what could be better that
C10,our mineserverTM is way better
C10,it is cheaper to run
C10,according to energystargov the average home pc costs about per year to run
C10,our mineserverTM costs about per year to run
C9,your pc monitor the monitor uses about two watts in sleep mode
C10,our mineserverTM does not a monitor and uses two watts to support simultaneous players
C10,it is cheaper to buy
C1,try finding another brandnew dedicated plugandplay server
C10,if you take energy costs into account that old pc in the closet is not cheap after all
C10,it does not slow down dads pc
C1,you know how dad hates that
C10,it boots straight into minecraft
C1,your old pc will not do that
C10,it is easy to find
C10,every mineserverTM has a unique name chosen by its owner wildweaselmineservercom example and can be discovered by players you like below from all over the internet without ever using ip address
C10,it is easy to administer
C9,most minecraft servers use a command line interface
C1,how are your linux sysadmin chops
C1,not good eh
C9,most home minecraft servers are not effectively administered at all
C10,but our mineserverTM comes with a tiny web server that allows the server to be monitored with a graphical interface from a parental pc or from our free ios or android phone apps
C10,from the dairy aisle at the supermarket mom can reboot the server or ban a specific player who she sees from the scrolling chat log is using bad language
C10,she can even maintain a whitelist of accepted players with all others kept out
C10,and it is fast really fast
C10,you might not expect a mineserverTM to keep up with big commercial servers but there is a huge advantage to operating a local network opposed to the broader internet
C9,if your internet connection is rated at or megabits per second is typical that is how fast minecraft can run
C10,but our mineserverTM lives a gigabit ethernet connection generally straight to your home router
C9,that is times faster a commercial minecraft server
C10,and our mineserver proTM is even faster
C2,we got a little carried away one day and built a minecraft supercomputer those who want even performance
C10,with twice many cores and twice much memory running at a clock speed that is a third faster our mineserverTM the mineserver proTM could easily handle players but we limit it to players to keep things running a bit cooler
C10,it still costs only about per year to run
C10,cheaper easier safer faster and even faster
C9,a note about networking
C2,we love ethernet but to some folks it is a wifi world we a wifi option our mineserversTM and wifi is built in all our mineserver prosTM
C2,let us talk you out of using it
C9,wifi ours is n is slower gigethernet and even if all your computers at home are connected by wifi you probably do not wifi in your mineserverTM to reach them
C10,that is because the best mineserverTM installation is plugged directly into ethernet port your router or wifi access point
C7,use that wifi not ours because using ours introduces yet another wifi roundtrip hop router or access point to mineserverTM and back to router or access point slowing the whole thing down when running a single radio
C7,and do not even think of creating a standalone minecraft wifi network because the minecraft clients to be able to reach over the internet mojangs authorization servers in order to work at all
C1,but if you really really want wifi order it because it cannot be added later to your mineserverTMTM sorry
C10,our mine servers is the worlds home minecraft server that you can buy
C10,it is cheaper a rental server
C10,it is faster a rental or public server
C10,it doesent require a pc
C10,it only costs about a dollar per year to run
C10,no ip address is required ever
C10,play with your friends
C10,no public server pervs
C10,a parental admin phone controls the server
C10,boot straight into minecraft with web based admin and mods
C10,play minecraft with friends all over the world
C10,unlimited tnt
C10,it is a version of minecraft server except instead of having it based your computer you a physical copy a microcomputer
C1,the surface are easy anybody to use all you to do is power it and play
C10,it automatically boots up the minecraft server and all you to do is access it like you would any other server your computer
C1,once you log into the server you can play with your friends your family anybody
C10,is your mineserver
C10,you can see it is small it is lightweight has a little linux computer three usb ports and ethernet ports or wi fi
C10,you connect the power cable here and plug it into your wall socket and then plug your ethernet or wifi cable into here and you plug it into ethernet or wifi
C10,there is a vanilla minecraft what you can maintain over the internet and you can add mods plugins maps
C10,you go into you minecraft multiplayer settings you do not to add the ip it is already in there and then you got your server up and running
C10,is small it is possible to lose it but it is probably pluged in you probably will not to worry about that and plus you probably even know if you loose it you probably find it if you loose it but that is a very rare chance
C10,there has to be some administration and we two administrative interfaces the both web servers
C10,one is complex web server putting in mods and things like that and the other is what we are were calling the parental admin is really a phone that monitors the server allows the parent to see what is going can shut it down or turn it or reboot it and can kickoff players if they misbehave
C10,the children and the parents access of who they can invite in and you to be invited in and no one can come in
C10,a parent you control let us say your child has not finished their homework you can temporarily block your own child or or somebody has done something naughty you can block them
C10,you can manage every single part of the server
C10,you can manage people who join you can manage the mods it is the world everything
C10,and that you can make it whitelisted you can keep the pervs out
C10,our minecraft servers that we sell costs only forever
C10,with the single timecost of you are not paying a monthly weekly or yearly rate to rent a server
C2,like we know a few friends that used to rent a server and they bought theirs a month and that means in months it is already over the server and is forever
C10,mineserver is better other minecraft servers because it is small it is plug and play it is portable it is fast it does not require a pc you can maintain it over the internet and it is cheap less a hundred bucks
C10,there is advantage to playing a smaller server instead of a giant server
C10,you will a faster game you will memory per player it is much faster to a local server a huge person server
C10,it allows you to your own minecraft server cheap and forever cheap forever and yeah
C2,if i was employed i would take definitely the one since is forever like you can it until you die literally
C10,if someone thinks they are going to copy it is not going to work
C10,it is all custom because that is what we had to do and the boys did it and we brought in our friends who are in a heavy duty programmers in various industries and thing really works
C2,we are the people with the diamond swords and other people with the wind swords one do you pick
C2,we tried like a year ago and the boys are really the ones who brought it back a year later
C2,it was something that greed greed fallonyeah the youngest was not letting go of it and through their persistence is how it has come back to life
C2,i hope they pay us maybe
C2,mineserver llc was a company that i started with my two brothers and my father
C2,working with my dad and brother has interesting
C2,it is definitely a new experience that i not had before
C2,i any experience of working with people before i to work with people
C2,a mom of boys they are either let us say about playing with one another love one having a good time or they are trying to kill one another
C2,and is something to unite them and give them the attention they are talking about their ideas what they want to see they are talking about the future possibilities or it it is really kind of professional nice to see them getting along
C2,i am in charge of minserver

C8,every os you order you can choose your style at the end of the campaign
C10,a mobile that understands your needs
C6,it was our goal to create that you never needed to open one that works by itself
C2,and we made every effort possible the o only alerts you when it actually should
C10,the basics are simple always alert when you lose something or forget something at home at the office or at a friends place

C8,a backer you will be able to suggest what we include
C10,below are some examples
C2,there were a couple of tricky challenges when we went from design the drawing board to functional production design
C10,it was a real priority to minimize size make the device waterproof and prevent the battery from starting to drain before a customer starts using the product
C10,our pcbs printed circuit boards are custommade to perfectly fit our case and take up little space possible
C10,the casing we use abs the highly durable plastic used lego bricks
C10,our devices consist of two plastic parts that are assembled with a technique called ultrasonic welding to achieve a totally flush waterproof finish
C10,finally we use a small pet slip that needs to be pulled out the battery to connect to the circuit
C10,a highly pressurized silicon rubber fills the tiny gap it stays waterproof afterwards
C10,it is a neat and extremely resourceefficient solution
C4,if you are interested to see of how the behaves we made some short demo videos you to check out with our ugly prototype
C10,connect devices make a virtual leash and loss alerts
C10,define safe zones and no alerts while safe
C10,mark item essential and reminder when leaving without it
C7,we are asking your help here kickstarter
C6,the funds we raise will be used to

C7,hi kickstarter thank you checking out our campaign
C2,we are shield northwest a company based in portland oregon that specializes in face masks our fellow skiers and snowboarders
C2,being snow lovers ourselves we noticed a few problems with the traditional over the head masks
C10,aside from being uncomfortably tight fitting there a pain to put and take off especially when you re wearing bulky ski gloves
C1,whenever you want some fresh air you to take off all your gear at the ski lift
C10,the two master slightly better concept but forget about turning your head without having to pull the mass back up
C10,it is constantly falling down around arround your neck defeating the purpose of wearing a mask at all and the old school fleece and cotton fails to protect you from the cold and snow
C10,shield has createed a simple yet totally practical solution
C2,our team has envisioned and integrated a custom bendable nose piece that maximizes comfort and functionality of the mask
C2,our team searched high and low a material that defends against the elements without compromising the breathability and comfort of the mask
C2,we finally found a lightweight outer shell that works to shield your face from wind and snow and rain does not stand a chance
C7,with your help we would like to collect enough funds to be able to cover the expensive material and manufacturing cost of our product we can them shipped to you before ski season
C7,thanks again your time and we are looking forward to getting product to you

C10,purpleTM is soft where you want it and firm where you it providing you with optimal body alignment and comfort
C10,purpleTM vs other mattress tech
C10,what is the purpleTM top
C10,the purpleTM top improves your existing mattress

C1,but if you a soft pillow top mattress or if your mattress has a big sag in it the purpleTM top will not fix the problem
C10,the purpleTM top improves goodbutfirm mattresses it is not a bandaid broken down mattresses
C1,your mattress may be alright but is not time allnight comfort
C2,we sent purpleTM tops to a handful of people who had never experienced the technology
C5,heres what they had to say

C10,what is the purple stress reliever
C10,okay in all reality it is a simple x sample of purpleTM
C10,but it is honestly one of the coolest samples you may ever receive you can use it a stress reliever or a pen holder or pop it in the fridge a bit and use it a teething toy your munchkin
C2,we do not condone violence but you can shoot them across the room that is why we are giving you two because it pays to be prepared
C2,how did purpleTM come about
C2,found two brothers engineers tony and terry pearce fly fishing in the rockies and talking about partnering to change the world
C2,tonys years of experience in advanced aerospace materials and terrys years of experience in manufacturing design and project management led to a partnership creating hightech carbon fiber sporting goods and wheelchairs
C5,by wheelchair users that were testing the pearces wheelchairs let them know that the real was in better wheelchair cushioning ressure sores were a really bad part of their lives
C2,taking that challenge the pearces created floamTM the worlds lightestweight cushioning fluid
C3,soon floamTM had five patents and was being used in not only wheelchair cushions but by major licensees of the pearces in criticalcare medical beds hillrom footwear nike ankleknee braces johnson johnson golf bag straps topflite neonatal intensive care preemie baby nests surgical positioning cushions surgical tourniquet cushions ballet cushions industrial knee pads and
C2,known the worlds most advanced cushioning products the pearces set out to create a technology that could revolutionize cushioning at a much lower cost floamTM
C2,purpleTM began to evolve through a series of discoveries and product developments
C2,the breakthrough came in the s when the pearces invented hyperelastic polymer
C10,amazingly soft strong material could stretch times its resting size was uberdurable and never took a body impression
C9,the key discovery came when hyperelastic polymer was molded in a shape that could release under pressure hot spots redistributing the pressure to other areas
C10,the same feature turned out to give amazing back support in mattresses
C9,time went the predecessorproducts of purpleTM came to be licensed to makers of critical care medical beds stryker medical
C10,consumer mattresses in europe swan by ekornes japan francebed and australia sleepmaker backpack straps jansport shoe insoles dr scholls massaging gel and sofsole pillows sleep innovations softcatch toy balls nickelodeon seat cushions wondergel wheelchair cushions equapressure and many other advanced cushioning products
C3,in all the pearces over cushioning patents and are known the world over the premier source superior cushioning technology
C2,three years ago the pearces set out to combine all their knowledge of cushioning into the worlds best mattress
C9,hyperelastomeric polymer had never able to be molded into pieces large kingsize mattresses
C9,even with only partial surface coverage the mattresses made in australia and europe were too expensive to hope of millions of people getting comfortable
C9,to make great mattresses the whole surface needed to be hyperelastic polymer and the mattresses needed to be produced at high rates with low labor input
C3,a patentpending machine called mattress max was created taking over two years and several million dollars
C10,purpleTM mattresses is made in the usa by mattress max in single pieces large enough to fully cover a kingsize mattress and at production ratescosts that will help millions of people change their lives
C6,better any mattress about that was the goal and purpleTM achieved it
C10,why purpleTM why not it is awesome color and it signifies treating everyone like royalty
C2,the pearces spent most of their hightech careers advancing the world of cushioning
C2,with purpleTM they know they put all they learned into the worlds greatest bed and they figured out how to do it everyone can afford it
C6,where are we in the launch effort
C8,we decided to use kickstarter a channel to introduce the world to purple
C3,we developing advanced cushioning technologies over years and our proprietary patented hyperelasticTM polymer purpleTM is the latest advancement in that technology
C2,we the capability to build all the product inhouse
C2,we will always be honest with you
C2,we are not raising money to fund the manufacturing of purple
C2,heck we are pros at that
C1,you can be rest assured that if you help fund purple you are going to purple
C2,we are confident that once you sit and sleep purple you will let your neighbors family and friends know what we know purple is going to change your life
C2,since we manufacturing covered what are you helping to fund
C7,but like most other campaigns your preorders will allow us to bring in the last offsite components to move into full production our national product launch
C8,unlike some other kickstarters we will not drop the ball
C10,you will your products and them very soon
C7,stay tuned updates
C2,meet the team
C2,still not convinced we did the raw egg test with a clear plate purple and a mediumsoft polyurethane foam to how purpleTM stands up to the pressure or gives in to it is accurate in case
C2,we made a lovely little gif but the raw audio no pun intended of the egg foam was too good to pass up
C5,like us facebook at wwwfacebookcomlifeonpurple
C1,the mattress industry has a serious problem
C1,the problem is the mattress and there s nothing quite like mattress shopping
C1,but hey that price hopefully you can finally sleep comfortably nope same old mattress technology same old back pain
C9,but you know what we are scientists and professional sleepers and we knew of a better way to sleep comfy without having depon the dock and that is why we invented purple the worlds ever hyperelastic polymer mattress
C9,if it sounds a little sciency that is because it is
C9,the only real innovation in mattress texture when foam mattresses were cool
C10,purple is incredibly comfortable and it is different any other mattress you tried
C10,let us take a moment to look at how purple compares to other mattresses out there
C10,memory foam is not fun jumping it allows your body to sink in then keep skining until you are stuck and hot and sweaty
C10,purple though not great jumping is perfect sleeping
C10,purple is soft and firm at the same time depending what area of your body it is touching and purple will never ever leave a body impression in your mattress
C9,why because we are scientists and we made it that way
C10,we design purple how you would custom design your best friend you know if you could do that
C10,purple will take the pressure you do not to and it s there to support you when and where you it the most that means body alignment
C10,when purple feels the pressure like under your hips and shoulders it releases you can sleep comfy giving you the support you craven aligning your body you do not to keep your chiropractor retainer anymore and purple is temperature neutral it allows plenty of air flow no sweaty nights
C2,the average sleepers we are we know that it takes your body a little time to adjust to a new mattress and that is why we offer a risk free why not try it one hundred night guarantee and the off chance you do not like it no worries we ll pick it up from your house free of charge and you will a full refund
C9,purple is the culmination of years of research and development we doing a while and our technologies licensed to brands like nike and dr scholl s yeah we do know what we re doing
C10,here is something to chew purple is made in the usa from completely non toxic food grade material
C10,and in purple we sell direct to the consumer means no middleman markups and no markups marking up sake
C2,we believe that everyone should be able to afford the worlds best mattress you are welcome
C1,maybe you think your mattress is alright the purple mattress topper turns all right comfort in to allnight comfort and your butt might be saying hey i want it some of that sweet purple comfort too
C2,hey we hear your but loud and clear that is why we invented the purple seat cushion
C7,use it work in your car wherever that extra comforts needed and how does it work that
C6,the seat cushion will be sent right after a campaign funds you do not to wait to experience purples life changing comfort
C2,my brother and i working mattresses and cushioning years

C2,the birth of amber
C2,being apple lovers it is no surprise that we got our hands apple watch at its soonest available time
C2,during the long awaited period we actively discussed and brainstormed how we could best charge it the go
C2,it is our belief that ideal power bank apple watch should meet the following requirements
C10,it must be able to charge apple watch the go
C1,with conventional power banks the watch would easily disconnect from the magnetic connector
C2,we knew we needed one that would securely hold it in place
C10,it would be able to power other devices we would not to carry multiple power banks
C2,from these initial criteria amber was born
C10,polishing amber
C2,we set to work to build and along the way came up with a creative solution to keep the meter cable secure and elegantly hidden
C4,through trial and error we designed a special spool the charging cable fits snugly around
C10,can then securely fit the magnetic connector
C10,we crafted a cover to place over the spool exposing only the connector creating a spacesaving and attractive case following the beautiful apple aesthetic that we come to know and love
C10,video shows how to twine your m or m apple watch charging cable onto ambers spool
C10,not a smart power bank but a best in class charger
C1,conventional power banks are not suitable daily charging because
C1,when they completely drained and not used a period of time it cannot immediately charge other devices even if it is connected to a power source and charging
C1,conventional power banks voltage will become unstable when overloaded due to simultaneously charging devices and being charged with input and output occurring at the same time
C1,unstable voltage will adversely affect the life and stability of the batteries
C2,with that in mind we improved ambers circuitry that when it is connected to a power source amber will continue to charge your apple watch iphone and amber itself directly through the external power supply
C10,by directing the incoming electric current flow outward amber effectively saves its battery cycle life
C10,and when amber itself runs out of charge it simply functions a normal charger and powers devices immediately
C10,simply plug amber in and it will power your apple watch and iphone simultaneously all while charging itself
C10,raising amber with the best
C9,the foundation of any power bank is of course the battery
C2,is why we chose worldclass battery manufacturer desay our supplier
C4,all desay batteries are subjected to a battery of tests we could not help ourselves before leaving the factory exposing them to extreme temperatures intense pressure and aging tests
C2,to ensure quality at every step of the production process we chose the biggest and best factory in the world foxconn
C2,we already conducted two successful preproduction trials and we can guarantee that amber will be subjected to strict and rigorous testing
C10,getting amber to market
C4,trial production successfully completed ie evt engineering verification test
C4,ambers electrical components fully tested and verified
C4,second trial production completed ie dvt design verification test
C4,ambers moldings were rigorously tested and tuned
C7,check out video and watch amber come together
C4,a simple test of ambers prototype
C10,amber will come in multiple colours
C10,yes like iphones and apple watches

C10,dobot is super easy to control
C10,easy usability comes during the design of dobot
C2,we given a lot of thought users without technical backgrounds and how to help them better control robotic arms
C9,in order to make young yearsold kids able to use dobot in ease we done extensive research and designed controlling methods including pc mobile eeg voice vision leap motion and gestures whichever suits your purpose the best
C10,stepper motor dobot works quietly
C2,we considered where the users will be using it and tired our best to make the noise level low possible
C2,by using customized stepper motor we are able to minimize noise level making dobot much quieter lowcost servo robotic arms and householdfriendly
C10,heres a comparison video with servo based robotic arms
C10,dobot is open source
C10,dobot will be open sourced after the kickstarter campaign
C2,a group of devoted open source fans we believe open source makes the world better by levering the power of collective minds
C2,yet to help you understand better of what we do we are working around the clock some of the code that notations and explanations
C6,but we make our promise here that after the kickstarter campaign we will upload the code
C7,keep in touch there are surprises to come
C10,dobot supports three opensource firmware special application and developer
C1,even exciting makers
C10,dobot supports three opensource firmware special applications and developers with different programming preferences
C2,complete developed by dobot team easy developers familiar with industrial robots
C1,base grbl httpsgithubcomgrblgrbl easy developers familiar with open source cnc machine
C1,base marlin httpsgithubcommarlinfirmwaremarlin easy developers familiar with reprap compatiable d printer
C10,we provide communication interface opencv httpopencvorg to add vision to dobot
C2,dobot is a maker team and we create what is best makers
C10,we use arduino the controller
C10,although when tackling some critical problems we found might not be the perfect solution after continuous improvements we believe could equip superb functionality with dobot
C10,processing is the widelyapplauded data visualization and programming platform beginners
C1,simply drag and click you can program dobot at your will its userfriendly interface
C10,scratch is a briiliant visual programming language that is widely used by children artists and makers
C10,it helps them to control and program all types of electronic devices and interactive products
C9,dobots control is based the easyforunderstanding serial communication protocol whose working principles are all opensourced
C6,we will add manpower in developing control extensions based scratch and believe will make operating dobot applications easier children enabling them to bring their ideas to life
C10,arduino library
C5,we included diversified written motion functions user to make their own dobot code community
C2,we included forward and inverse solution point to point line jump path planning everything is open source and you can make it better
C10,these code examples very similar principles to industrial robot developing and they are very useful one who wants to understand how industrial robot works
C2,in our code we provide the limit and working range protection various joint and coordinate commands combine these functions and you are the magician
C10,electronic parts
C2,our initial thought was to design a shield the arduino mega connecting mega and stepper driver boards and to contain a current amplifying module to drive the vacuum pump and the solenoid valve
C10,meanwhile it can manage driving servos with steppers
C2,based that we modified the design to accommodate users thus another shield of arduino was born to satisfy all of the above functions
C10,eliminates the constitute of stepper driver boards and reconsiders the measures overcurrent protection and heat dissipation
C2,our core competency is to employ fewer wires with a better outlook ensured
C10,tech spec
C8,rewards
C10,the quality assurance
C10,mechanical parts
C2,how dobot is made and how we made its incredible precision level possible
C10,the mechanical structure entirely employed cnc cutting technology
C10,key parts the machinery accuracy has reached mm
C10,joint connections adopted high accuracy axes coupled with chrome alloy interference lit ensuring structural stability and accuracy
C10,the motor side dobot designed the high accuracy speed reducer motor providing consistent motor power the robot arm
C10,the material side dobot was made of high strength aluminium alloy and processed by anodic oxidation treatment to ensure the sleekness and strength of the surface
C2,heres some details about the manufacturing we chose the high performance cnc machine instead of laser cut to guarantee a mm precision provides the basis of our high quality
C2,software we done a great deal of optimization
C10,the software supports speed lookahead small line blocks interpolation algorithm able to fit any type of curve and ensure processing efficiency
C10,moreover with the three axes linkage method fine interpolation you can control the trajectory of the end effector of the dobot accurately empowering it with complex curvilinear motions
C10,dobot is affordable
C2,we wanted to make sure dobot is accessible to everyone
C2,through immense effort and countless negotiations with suppliers we were able to better deals without compromising the quality and reliability

C10,kickstarter friends
C7,thank you looking at our design project
C10,velostrap is unbelievably simple stable and inexpensive way to attach a smartphone to the handlebars or stem of a bicycle
C10,velostrap mounts any device in a portrait or landscape position up front where you convenient and direct access to it
C10,velostrap in landscape mode
C10,velostrap in portrait mode
C2,my idea started back in while i was recovering from a motorcycle accident
C1,the issue then was my cellphone was always falling from anywhere it was placed while moving in my wheelchair
C1,if i put it in my rear pocket i would sit it if i put it in my front pocket it was impossible to reach
C2,the thought of something quick and easy to hold the phone became a set of rubber bands that wrapped around the phone and under one of the handles the wheelchair
C2,it worked fairly in fact much better i had hoped
C2,still doing wheelies
C2,early rubber bands iphone and wheelchair the beginnings
C2,a very used set of rubber bands
C2,part of my exercise routine after being in the wheelchair was thankfully riding a bicycle again but i rode my lingering problem with exceptions to my back was still the cell phone
C2,where do i put it the realization of how these worked a bike became obvious after my ride
C2,early design worked keeping the rubber bands straight was a problem but the ideas morphed from here
C10,the quick and easy access with the rubber bands was undeniable and if you ride a bicycle like us you can attest to
C10,it easily fixed these issues
C10,fumbling with it in pockets
C10,ringing in the backpack ugh and having to search it
C10,realizing it was a call that did not to be answered
C10,changing songs or music settings
C10,having to stop and start riding again
C2,i met a mountain biker the trail recently that had his iphone in a ziplock baggie stuffed in his lycra shorts wth really
C2,top of all these issues we all seen the badly designed cell phone mounts available that do not work in the real world
C1,they are expensive tools to install and remove are cumbersome to attach do not fit all cell phones meaning the upgrade to your new phone requires another mount equaling will snap and break with minor impacts from dropping or laying down the bike but most of all they look absolutely hideous sticking up from the handlebars
C1,any selfrespecting cyclist would not buy one of these let alone attach it to their favorite bike
C5,here below are some quotes about some of the selfdescribed best other mounts out there a very popular and respected review blog
C10,problem with all these bling cases is they are expensive
C2,i am waiting till they come out with a iphone case i can use my new phone
C10,but there is still the lightening adapter issue with external batteries
C10,looks nice but it does not work
C5,if i may add to review
C2,i am my second failed xxxxxxxx case and my second bike mount
C10,saw and got hyped
C10,saw the price and did not enjoy it any
C10,samsung galaxy user here
C10,any thoughts producing something us
C10,the phone case looks great but it will not accommodate my iphone with the mophie juice pack and i cannot use my mountain bike rides without the extended battery life
C10,make a case that takes a mophie into account and i will seriously consider buying one and and
C10,the time velostrap is
C2,one of the earlier d designs of velostrap
C10,a production run early velostrap
C10,rd generation clear velostrap simplistic and useful design
C10,a perspective of the size of velostrap
C2,our rd design is the clear velostrap in the photos
C10,it is simplistic design allows the user to easily attach a cellphone smartphone or other device to any landscape or portrait position their bike from the handlebars to the stem
C10,it is easy to attach and remove that you can even do it with gloves and while you are still riding
C10,there are no straps to loop over or through velostrap
C10,pull over the ends of your phone and it is secured
C10,side shot showing how velostrap secures your device
C10,minor crashes and impacts are no problem we designed velostrap to allow small movements to keep the hard jarring to a minimum
C8,unlike the other mounts available velostrap is inexpensive we plan pricing at plus shipping and fits devices from ipods all iphones including the s plus sony xperias htc etc
C10,it fits large phones like the huge samsung galaxy note
C10,velostrap mounts and dismounts easily with no tools to install and last but certainly not least velostrap looks great and enables the user to full access to the controls of their digital displays right at their fingertips
C10,and if you are a photo taker while your rides like me velostrap makes it super easy removing and reattaching watch the video
C10,velostrap does not take away anything from the looks of your bike and in fact looks right at home sexy
C1,with apps and music available these new smart phones it makes complete sense to attach a device to your bike
C10,you can of course listen to music but speed time elevation and other information in realtime with basic applications available from apple and android
C1,within the last year or heart rate monitors and are available
C1,even if you do not use these apps it is a great idea to a phone attached like easy and quick use in case like me with family someone needs to reach you
C10,velostrap works with all smartphones including iphone plus
C10,iphone in portrait position
C10,sony xperia portrait mode
C10,velostrap even works with items small the st gen ipod nano
C10,velostrap works with beach cruisers townies etc
C10,beachcruiser and sony portrait mode
C10,velostrap works with road cyclocross and and other handlebar combos
C10,like bmx bike
C10,navigation ready to use at your fingertips
C10,landscape navigation
C10,velostrap is the culmination of our work to perfect riding with a smartphone
C10,friends and family put literally hundreds of untold miles different variations of bikes from road bikes to mountain bikes to beach cruisers to stationary bikes and even treadmills using velostrap without one single failure
C10,although velostrap looks like a simple piece of rubber that could never hold a phone rest assured it works described
C10,the tension and composite materials of velostrap adjusted through several designs to make sure it attaches your cell phone properly
C1,other soft mount designs before velostrap would you believe that you to loop the strap or rubber device around itself to protect it before hanging it your handlebars is absolutely not the case
C10,in fact these designs sit the phone up higher and make them unstable all we suggest is that you a good case to keep the movement over rough terrain from scratching your device
C10,watch the video and you can see even with a hard plastic phone case around the doublesided glass sony xperia how velostrap controls the hard impacts and keeps your expensive phone secure
C10,velostrap can even hold your creditdebit cards and drivers license when not attached to your bike
C10,or attach it like with another velostrap
C2,here is what is finished with our velostrap project far
C2,d designs updated and paid and rd generation design is done
C2,composite materials decided correct tensions and strength
C2,the molds at the manufacturer are made and ready to go
C2,manufacturer has already sent us final design pieces of velostrap
C4,field testing is done and velostrap is ready st production run
C5,velostraps website is finished and will be up and running the kickstarter community can view it the purchase features will not be working and there will be several updates to the pictures and video
C3,logos and branding are almost completed and trademark plus copyright applications are ready to be filed
C3,the provisional patent velostrap has filed paid and receipted
C6,what the kickstarter funding will be used
C6,pay the initial order of velostraps november
C6,ready orders november
C6,start and finish deliveries to kickstarter funders january
C6,velostrap online store open business march
C10,wwwvelostrapcom
C10,velostrapit simply works
C10,since the initial and important things with velostrap already done bringing velostrap to market will be very quick
C8,once funding closes through kickstarter the website will be fully operational and working and we will be ready to accept orders online but not before fulfilling our kickstarter funders
C7,help us bring velostrap to market
C2,hi kickstarter friends my name is paul dodenhof
C7,thank you taking a look at our design project velostrap
C10,the simple reliable and inexpensive way to attach any smartphone to a bicycle
C10,is velostrap and is how easy it works
C2,the actual idea velostrap came while i was recovering from a motorcycle accident
C2,my dr had me wheeling around in a wheelchair and i could not figure out where to put my phone
C1,you can imagine your hands are always in use with a wheelchair making holding a phone nearly impossible
C2,because i used my device much pictures with family etc it became necessary to device something that would work
C2,i took three rubber bands and it worked very in fact much better i would ever hoped
C2,after i started riding bicycles again it dawned to me that that idea worked incredibly with bicycles too
C2,that was the beginning of velostrap
C10,unlike hardmounts to jar your phone over every bump in the trailer road we designed velostrap to allow slight movements while you ride to keep the hard jarring over bumps to absolute minimum
C10,hardmounts are expensive they to be assembled with tools they usually work with only one model of phone means spending money a new mount when you a new phone but mostly they look horrible the front of your bike
C5,and check out what these youtube reviewers said about their hardphone mounts
C10,i right trails means it is the nice smooth road the most part but there was a crack in the road that i could not avoid and when i ran over at my phone was little attachment piece here and after i ran over the crack my phone went flying with
C10,we finished filming another way back to straight out of the mount even though it was secured
C10,phone falling of your bike not with velostrap
C1,let us to some action video you can see firsthand how velostrap works
C2,video we are going to use a mountain bike that has no front suspension and no rear suspension you a real view of how velostrap works some of the most demanding terrain in southern california
C1,you might be thinking that you would not trust a piece of plastic with your expensive smartphone but do not underestimate the simplistic design
C10,velostrap does use the latest in high tech composites to make it work and everyone can a real sense of how durable velostrap is how much we trust the design we made outrageous and overblown video of velostrap in action
C2,we went to local skater hang out is a concrete staircase that will literally jar your teeth loose you go down it
C10,with no suspension test would be over the top any bike component but especially a cell phone holder
C2,i put velostrap upside down check out
C10,what you see in the video is the same thing that happens in crashes
C10,the phone moves enough to reduce the impact but stays attached to the bike it does not jarred and damaged or simply fly off
C10,velostrap is simplicity at its best
C10,you can see velostrap works and it does it with no clunky contraptions attached to the front of your bike
C10,one of the greatest features of velostrap is the ability to quickly shoot photos
C1,when it is right at your fingertips you never miss the shots or having to fumble through your pockets or backpack to located
C10,wearing gloves do not even try with the other mounts
C10,even the soft rubber mounts similar to velostrap were a pain in the butt with gloves because of their design but with villa strap it is no problem
C10,you a quick picture while you are still riding again no problem
C10,it is easy with velostrap and if you a phone call that has to be answered it simply unhooks easy access
C10,no searching while your phone is ringing find out you did not even to answer the call
C10,with velostrap you can see the call or text right in front of you
C10,velostrap works with iphones like the iphone like iphone and the new iphone plus it works samsungs like galaxy s works sony s like xperia and even works larger phones like the samsung note but the nice thing is that it works small devices like the ipod nano
C10,it will work beach cruisers road bikes cyclocross bikes like one and of course it works mountain bike
C10,velostrap fits them all no to replace your mount every time you a new phone and it under retail it is enough of a bargain that you can buy one your friends and family
C10,listen a cyclist and a rider you and i know it is not the actual act of carrying a phone that is issue it is the fact that velostrap makes it convenient when it is right at your fingertips
C10,when you are done with your ride hang velostrap your handlebars and it is ready your next ride
C10,and if you buy velostrap you can even attach a debit card or credit card those quick rides when you do not space them elsewhere
C2,i around bicycles my whole life from bmx in the s till mountain bikes
C2,i used a lot of different parts over the years some worked and some of them did not
C2,i know velostrap is our invention but rest assured velostrap will change the way you ride
C4,our velostrap project is underway we already paid the molds and several final design bella straps tested durability and function
C2,our selling website is build and paid
C2,the advertising logos are almost done
C3,the patents filed and payed and the trademarks are being registered
C6,alle we is you our kickstarter friends to bring incredible product to market
C8,of course if you ride any bike at all it makes sense to pledge to help but you can help by sharing our kickstarter project page and by contacting others about velostrap through facebook youtube instagram and other sites
C10,there are many cell phone mounts the market today but nothing like velostrap
C7,please help fund our project and product available to every rider out there
C7,thank you very much

C2,the aegis story
C2,we want to protect those we love
C1,the trouble is that no one wants to admit they cannot hear it is difficult to tell if someone is suffering from hearing loss
C9,our ears are exceptionally delicate and todays unsafe listening practices are damaging our longterm hearing
C2,sixteenyearold kingsley cheng with a dedicated initiative to help children teens and adults protect themselves and those they love from noiseinduced hearing loss is set to revolutionize safe listening habits
C10,introducing the aegis pro
C10,whether it is in our music or our gaming the world health organization advocates we protect our hearing by keeping the volume down
C10,with the volume limiting and noise cancelling technology of aegis pro headphones we can do that
C10,aegis pro is the worlds and only studio quality wireless headphones outfitted with our newly optimized jamsdefender technology a technology combining volume limiting active noise cancellation and digital decibel equalizer
C10,todays music and gaming audio is recorded at different and sometimes unsafe volumes
C10,our aegis pro digital decibel equalizer optimizes the originally recorded volume while the db volume limiting circuitry ensures the audio no matter how high the volume is cranked retains its quality at safe levels
C10,you can enjoy wireless listening freedom and mobility while the active noise cancelling anc system reduces unwanted ambient sounds
C10,you can increase productivity you focus your work anywhereanytime
C10,you will hear nothing but your audio
C10,our stylistic aegis pro headphones are loaded with premium features less money
C10,aegis acoustics is working to change the way the world listens to music and audio all while protecting millions from hearing loss
C10,noiseinduced hearing loss
C9,noiseinduced hearing loss is caused by two factors loudness measured in db decibels and length of exposure
C9,it is the combination that can lead to permanent hearing loss
C9,anyone listening to audio above db extensive periods is at high risk
C10,digital decibel equalizer technology
C1,a risky imperfection with current generation volumelimiting technology is that the preset volume may read higher the recommended safety level of db
C10,our digital decibel equalizer technology normalizes the source volume down to db before bringing it back up to a safeguarded level of db
C10,not found in other products it is the safest and most consistent solution in the market today
C10,our innovative active noise cancellation technology cancels out distracting ambient noise up to improving both clarity and perception of volume
C10,immersed in your audio no longer will you be distracted when listening to music or playing games in noisy environments
C10,led indicators
C2,our dream is to promote responsible listening habits while enhancing the music movies andor gaming experience
C10,the led lights active monitoring system that lights in blue indicating safe levels yellow indicating reasonable levels and red indicating unsafe levels track and display listening duration
C10,the leds are positioned both ear cups designed parents can see and be assured their child is adhering to healthy listening durations
C10,there is a fun light show mode illustration purposes the lights can be switched off entirely if necessary
C10,the listening duration indicator continues to monitor duration even when lights are off
C10,active noise cancelling
C10,our advanced anc technology works with four builtin microphones that intelligently analyzes your surroundings and reduces noise levels with opposite frequency that cancels out ambient noise thereby giving your db volume much listenable clarity
C10,the cutting edge system allows users optimal choice of three different modes based the acoustic environment music movies and gaming
C10,dual speaker driver design
C1,it is time young and old alike to discover the perfectly balanced music and gaming audio produced by our twoway dual driver design strategically positioned in each ear chamber
C10,tuned with precision the dedicated low frequency driver harvests a deep smooth bass that blends into rather overwhelms the audio while the high frequency tweeter replicates crisp natural vocals
C10,you can relax and fully engage in your favorite sounds
C1,why is important it is all about what audioholics call the dumbing down of audio a trend of new generation listeners preferring the hypercompressed format of mps because their ears corrupted by lowquality tinny sound
C1,young listeners today are used to audio presented in low quality forums that their perception of quality sound has dramatically reduced unfortunately preference corrupted sound can destroy their hearing
C2,jonathan berger music professor at stanford university who has conducted acoustic tests with incoming students believes preference lowquality sound is a learned behavior
C9,his studies suggest that the lowquality pops and crackles call up memories of listening to vinyl transporting listeners back to the analoglistening days of their experiences with audio
C1,whether you prefer digital or analog you know good sound when you hear it
C1,those who fell in love with the tinny compressed sounds from their earbuds simply do not recognize quality audio
C9,nor do they understand that their hearing is at risk
C10,it is time to change all that and aegis pro headphones are the best way to do
C10,dual connectivity

C10,the wired functionality will only work if the battery has a charge or is charging
C10,additionally convenient buttons the ear cup let you manage your calls playlist and volume your bluetoothenabled phone
C10,what if you a call while you are watching a movie gaming or listening to music
C10,one click the headset instantly connects you to your call the built in micrphone allows you to engage in crystal clear conversations
C10,click again and you can play pause skip tracks andor make calls of your own

C10,how much electromagnetic radiation is emitted by the qi wireless charging system
C10,insignificantly little
C10,the principle of qi has used in electronic toothbrushes years without any known physical effects human health
C10,due to the low range of the qi wireless charging technology the electromagnetic radiation is severely limited
C10,electromagnetic radiation exists only in the immediate area of the qi wireless charging station and only when a device is placed there

C10,fluid is the worlds learning water meter
C1,your relationship with the water you use a daily basis will never be the same once you install fluid
C10,you will complete visibility into how when and where you use water
C2,we designed fluid it is easy to install and no plumber is required
C10,you simply snap fluid around the main water pipe coming into your home plug it in and connect it to your wifi network
C10,once installed and connected you will begin to see your water usage in realtime from any connected device
C10,fluid allows you to create what we are calling signatures to identify usage by each appliance or fixture
C10,simply run the appliance or fixture you want to create a signature and tell fluid to learn the water consumption flow pattern associated with that particular appliance or fixtures run cycle
C10,once a signature has recorded fluid will identify every time that particular appliance or fixture is running and track its consumption
C10,the end result is usage data that allows you to see how much water you are using things like showers laundry flushes dishwashing lawn irrigation etc
C10,fluid pays itself the time it catches a leak
C10,when fluid identifies constant or erratic water use you will a notification that there may be a possible leak or water that has left running
C10,it could be simple a garden hose that was left a running toilet or in a worst case scenario a pipe bursts when you are away from your home a trip or errand
C10,fluid gives you the peace of mind that you will not return home to huge water bills or thousands of dollars in water damages
C1,amazing things can happen once you become connected to the water you use
C10,you will become aware of how many loads of laundry you are doing weekly the length of your showers and other habits and behaviors
C10,making changes does not fall your shoulders after all fluid is a learning water meter
C10,once fluid begins collecting data how you use water it will begin surfacing recommendations steps you can take to conserve
C10,beyond making recommendations fluid empowers you to set monthly water consumption goals and tracks your progress toward reaching your goal
C10,all of these reductions in consumption mean lower water bills and money in your pocket
C8,we plan to support cloudtocloud integrations with existing smart home platforms including smartthings and nest upon delivery of the kickstarter devices
C2,we are exploring integration with other platforms such insteon wemo and wink
C2,we designed fluid to be open possible
C2,we believe in data portability and want to make using fluid seamless with your digital life
C2,we will provide a rest api developers to access fluids data and offer cloudtocloud integrations customers who are already using internetofthings platforms such smartthings
C10,fluid utilizes a robust and proven ultrasonic metering technology that has measuring the velocity of liquids and calculating the flow of these liquids within large industrial applications many years
C10,here is how it works there are two transducers within fluids enclosure are nonintrusive and are clamped the outside of the pipe
C10,these transducers send ultrasonic pulses in and against the flow direction
C10,fluid uses these ultrasonic pulses to measure velocity flow and transit time to calculate usage

C2,next we needed to make sure we could connect our device to wifi via a simple
C4,lastly we needed to begin visualizing the data being sent to our cloud computing environment by the prototype
C10,here is a short video of what the original data visualizations looked like
C4,after months of prototyping designing sourcing parts and components and working with awesome partners like the folks at particle we finalized our pcb design
C2,we finalized the design of the jig ensures that our transducers are properly fitted to the pipe every time fluid is snapped
C2,based the dimensions of our pcb our transducers and jig we were able to finalize the design of our enclosure
C2,lastly software development is underway
C10,fluid will be compatible with both ios and android right out of the box
C8,that brings us to kickstarter campaign

C1,you will feel even connected to your home and understand where and how to save money under water bills overtime
C10,installing fluid is easy you simply clamp it plug it in and connected to your wifi network
C10,once installed fluid begins learning one of the most unique features we ve created were calling signatures
C10,simply tell fluid to listen while you run the fixture appliance you want to add a signature to
C10,the water flow pattern and run cycle and then be saved
C10,from that point fluid can determine how much water each fixture or appliances using and when giving you total visibility to your water usage
C2,ever since we began developing fluid i become acutely aware of the water i use and the water being used around me
C2,awareness has changed my water usage behaviors and habits dramatically

C2,las vegas nevada where i traded nightlife mom life and not looked back
C1,becoming a mother is the most amazing experience but it is not without its challenges
C1,breast milk is undeniably the best source of nutrition infants today is busy lifestyles pumping is critical most moms to maintain their milk supply but it s complicated time consuming and moms without privacy it can even be embarrassing

C2,that is when i had the idea angel baby pumping and nursing wear
C2,i think it is important all women to feel good about what they wear especially postpartum
C1,moms enough to worry about because you are breastfeeding does not mean you should to feel frumpy and out of style
C4,developing angel baby tops has a long journey after many prototypes i finally found a seamstress was able to bring my vision to life

C10,of all it is a onepiece design garment with a builtin pumping bra and you were not to wear another bra with the shirt and there is plenty of support within the three layers that are compressive around the breast there has no underwires
C10,the openings are actually under the curve of the breast they do not show through the shirt and that is what you used to insert your funnels to connect to the pump and to breastfeed
C10,there is adjustable coverage you can pull the bando up or wear it lower depending how you want the garmin to fit you
C8,and with kickstarter we done really far with over k but kickstarter is all or nothing no one will charged unless i reach my full funding goal of by november th there is you know there has is a litttle bit of a rush here

C10,you are not exposing yourself and is how you breastfeed again
C10,the top of the rest is covered your stomach is covered there has there has no removing your clothing there has no to remember additional handsfree garmet that you can pump and you know if i had a jacket i would not to remove it to pump
C10,its very simple easy to use a very discreet obviously and i am defenetly hoping to address some of those issues with women feeling discriminated against with public breastfeeding and pumping
C1,a lot of moms are travelling they are in and out of airports there you know pumping in cars and is something that cannot only make it easier them but comfortable

C5,pakpod review youtubemicbergsma
C8,project is promoted byjellopa directresponse online advertising agency specializing in kickstarter campaigns facebook ads and google adwords
C2,i searched years a tripod i could anchor adjust a aim while holding my breath underwater
C10,something compact lightweight and super versail
C2,i could not find it i designed it
C2,hello iam a freediving filmmaker mechanical engineer and inventor of pakpod a total redesign of the standard issue trimont
C10,all three legs lock with a twist of one knob and extend with the push of a button
C10,pivoting lockable stakes make secure setups
C10,there are dozens of tie down points and board wrenches making a judgement the fly
C10,weighs less a pound and it s waterproof
C10,made with high impact abs and stainless steel
C2,the idea pakpod grew out of my frustration at not being able to buy the kind of tripod that could help me pass the stories i most passionate about
C1,i mean our cameras keep getting smaller and lighter but most tripods are still heavy and overbuilt and they do not connect two things
C10,pakpod connects
C3,pakpod has through five generations of prototyping and it is quick lock design is patent pending
C10,it is tweaked tested and tooled
C4,prototypes are fine but they are not the finished product
C2,having backed kickstarter projects i learned that the truth is in the tooling
C2,completing tooling pree kickstarter required a huge investment but me it was a must a small number of pakpods were manufactured testing purposes and to use a seed product
C7,they are rock solid and please note a limited number of these are available
C8,choose the reward early delivery if you would like yours before the holidays
C7,heres where you come in to bring to the world at affordable price we to raise enough capital to place a large manufacturing order
C8,that is what kickstarter is we want to put a pack pot in your hands about less expected retail price
C8,we hope you will invest in the future of filmmaking even if it is by choosing the back of buck reward you will help attract the crowd that crowdfunds tripod and looking ahead the world of pakpod is ready to grow
C2,we several innovative products in the pipeline is the beginning
C7,please check out the additional movies below to learn about using pakpod with monopods and other accessories in additional info warranties reward levels and product specifications

C10,it is a simple accessory turns any smartphone into a headup display
C10,moreover it eliminates many issues associated with projecting image onto a windshield including doubling of the image lack of reflection during daytime image size and a few others
C5,we received very positive response from potential customers dealers and retailers from many major representatives of the automotive industry

C10,can i perhaps watch video using hudway glass
C10,technically you can make sure you are properly parked before you start
C10,does it work with any
C10,yes any with hud mode here is example navmii
C1,there are million people in the world who behind the wheel of a car every single day
C3,according to the researches approximately of them distracted while driving it could be drinking coffee talking to a child in the back seat reaching the glove compartment changing a radio station and
C1,but the worst and most frequent distraction is our phone
C1,we are always the phone
C1,we talk read type tweet check and search we do selfies and share pictures
C1,we even do video conference calls while driving
C1,is especially dangerous when driving in low visibility conditions such rain fog snow or darkness we are nearly driving blind and trying to multitask with checking directions our smart phones
C1,that is when bad things happen
C3,indeed based official reports of all auto accidents happen because of a driver multitasking andor low visibility conditions that is deaths a day worldwide
C1,automakers are certainly aware of problem and they are looking solutions one of them headup displays huds can significantly improve the situation
C10,with huds drivers see information they right the windshield allows them to be totally focused the road at all times
C10,they no longer to look away from the road to read dashboard information or check directions the phone
C10,it allows drivers to focus the road keep their hands the wheel and mind driving
C1,today the market offers two main hud options cars
C10,to buy a new luxury car
C1,there are and cars manufactured with builtin hud displays
C1,it is estimated that by of all new cars will be equipped with hud displays currently it is
C1,these huds excellent image quality and onboard computer integration but they will cost you over option
C1,to buy a portable hud device
C1,is aftermarket solution that can be purchased separately and simply placed before a drivers eyes the dashboard
C1,kind of device is often equipped with a display or pico projector sensors special optics and wires to connect to the car or charging
C1,although much cheaper factory huds these devices still cost about
C2,we are offering alternative to these options
C2,we invented a car accessory a smartphone that turns it into a headup display
C10,it contains no electronic components and the phone is used image source thus we can make a hud affordable anyone
C10,the crux is in the glass it is the main hudway glass component a plastic lens very lightweight and of low fragility means that cuts are unlikely even if it gets broken
C10,the glass has aspheric shape allows to a larger image while at the same time minimize spherical comatic and chromatic aberrations
C10,in other words when looking through the curved glass you still see the road it is with no distortions
C10,but there has a thin multilayered glass coating is a secret sauce of hudway glass and its important feature
C10,its main purpose is to enhance the reflective properties of the glass and preserve its transparency that your view of the road is never obstructed
C2,knowing that all vehicles are different we realized we could not offer a single universal mount to suit any car
C10,apart from variations in dashboard shapes and sizes vehicles differ in drivers seating position
C10,even your height matters it dictates the angle in you look at the road
C10,adjustable and compact mount
C10,we made two simple dashboard mounts one compact the other adjustable allowing a pretty wide range of the angle
C10,both mounts are equipped with magnets to firmly hold the cradle with your phone it at the same time you can easily take it off the dashboard and place it back even without looking
C4,we came to these design solutions after several tries of creating prototypes
C1,indeed is the best and most reliable way to thoroughly study any issue
C4,we used home d printers some of the intermediate prototypes
C10,however all major modifications were tested the prototypes produced by industrial printers
C4,it allowed excellent printing quality and accuracy the prototypes margin of error against cad blueprints was within
C10,a special ios and android
C2,specifically our backers we are developing with screen options to use in headup display mode from a retro speedometer to a virtual bobblehead dog
C10,a special hudway glass kickstarter edition ios and android

C1,navigation systems available today are still proving to be unsafe diverting driver attention and focus away from the most important task in driving eyes the road
C1,current navigation systems require that drivers read and interpret data andor listen to audio commands has shown to take average time of seconds a typical adult driver
C9,not surprising it is seconds what is considered a safetime by various safety studies
C9,keeping in line with proven safety studies by nasa and other governmentsponsored research driver safety technology headup display hud based navigation technology has quickly become safer and effective road guidance method
C10,hud navigation keeps drivers visual attention the road while being guided
C10,it eliminates auditory distraction can force a driver to shift attention from paying attention to visual cues to simply listening to directions and back a proven distraction factor
C10,in short hudbased systems can be much intuitive in delivering navigational information the traditional displays while keeping the driver safe

C2,company has since launched a dozen of successful products the market
C2,alex and ivan cofounders of the project
C2,ivan and alex got their mba degrees in from college of business university of louisville ky usa
C2,the hudway project was born their graduate qualification work
C2,the idea came from alexs professional hobby rally racing in rally they copilots efficient navigation
C1,but copilots are humans who can naturally make mistakes thus a stronger confidence some additional cues would be helpful to pilots to verify the next maneuver
C1,and when driving along a narrow forest track at mph pilots absolutely no time to distracted by navigation monitors
C1,rally racers may drive like crazy yes but these guys are true experts in driving safety
C2,we developed navigation in poor visibility conditions hudwayappcom and over one million people tried it by
C2,inspired us to start a new beginning accessory production in we gone a long way from a mere idea to the real samples that people are using already
C2,and it would not happened without our united team where each person is a great specialist and a devoted teammate
C2,we are proud of them and would like to thank everyone their solid work commitment and loyalty

C2,hudwayglass was inspired by rally racing
C1,when you are driving miles per hour all your attentions focus the road ahead
C1,to look away even a second is extremely dangerous
C2,put in a head up display in the race car is one thing but we realized regular drivers face all the same distractions and using their smartphones while driving
C1,we put it to the chest the two most common distractions are reading directions of your phone and checking a speedometer
C1,causes to drive blind approximately ft every mile
C1,a typical mile trip we are distracted and driving blind over half a mile
C10,using hudway glass destruction time is reduced to nearly zero
C1,headupdisplays in cars do exist already but they tend to be very expensive and usually found only luxury vehicles
C1,some companys are developing affordable devices but they still cost several hundred dollars and are stuck in the midst of a very long and a complicated development process you still cannot buy them today
C1,at hudway we take a simple arrout let us face it your smartphone allready has everything you to project data a windshield
C10,big and bright display gps internet sensor the only thing is missing is a special optical glass to provide you high quality refelction of the screen day or night rain or shine the only thing missing is not missing anymore

C9,from the studies of the oldest piggy bank a small greek temple with a slit that dates back to the second century bc over moneybags a diverse range of animal studies interpretations of stacking coins to intensive studies with a clear focus the classical typology associated with a cute little pig
C2,we chosen the pig a symbol to bridge new and old
C5,the making of ernit has a long journey with a lot of meetings assembly testing feedback and another turn at the drawing board
C2,the design process has tightly accompanied by complex engineering work
C4,includes workshops with led lights to support the animation of the eyes firmware to connect the with the piggy bank pcb boards to control the different mechanisms and a lot of testing testing and testing
C5,thanks a million times to all of the families children and school classes that given us priceless feedback
C4,children and adults of all ages tested the ernit system
C10,technical specifications
C10,the is divided into a parent and a child section
C10,in the parent section you can invite grandma uncle or a friend to play a part in new learning experience
C10,here you can follow the different activities and learn even about how to give your girl or boy healthy financial habits
C10,the main part of the learning experience happens in the child section
C10,when they multiple goals at once they to prioritize between the different goals each time the piggy bank lights up
C10,a lesson and invite to learn about lots of different aspects of life
C10,the ernit let us your child set several goals the goal can be anything from a donation to charity over a new guitar to a gift to grandma
C10,it is important that it is your child that makes the decisions sure you can either accept or decline goals
C10,you can tell them that they should save and give they spend but in the end they will to swipe and push and press the that is how you empower them with financial wisdom
C10,the ernit encourages your child to save
C10,process
C6,the main goal of the has always to create intuitive approach to the flow
C4,the end result may look easy but the process behind the development has included a lot of wireframes ux designs and sketching
C10,some visualization studies of the saving progress
C10,it is important that the is intuitive both small kids and preteens that means a structure that is flexible and can be both simple and complex depending the task
C2,we chosen to test different combinations of colors and figurative symbols our own children our friends children and total strangers children to see what made sense
C10,has given the a balance between being fun to use and easy to understand
C2,today we completed roughly percent of the design and engineering phase and are beginning further testing and molding to give all of our backers the very exclusive batch of ernits
C7,by preordering you will be a part of our coming milestones like
C2,purchasing high quality injection molds production
C2,stretching towards additional ernit colors
C4,beta testing of the whole system with up to families

C10,are you interested to know details about each specific ride
C10,example the age range a ride or the time it will take average to build one or how much weight it can handle
C10,it would be too much to put it here we made a clear document you
C10,click here all specs
C10,a very important part of infento is that you can build your own rides together with your kid
C10,you will great fun together while you work your shared goal of completing the ride
C2,we designed truly multifunctional and multiadjustable parts
C10,means that when you are in something different or when you outgrow your ride the endless possibilities of infento simply brings you a new ride
C10,from toddler
C10,to teenager
C10,not only does infento bring unforgettable family moments by building the ride from the ground up your kid learns how to think creatively
C10,whole experience gives your child a technical skill set the future and teaches him that you can really build anything with the right mindset
C10,infento increases these important skills of your child
C10,you do not really think of but during childhood you buy a lot of rides your kids
C10,all these rides will cost you a ton of money and when your kids grow older they end up broken or unused a big pile somewhere
C2,the revolutionairy durable idea behind infento promises to change all of
C5,designboom worlds most popular design magazine formulated our durability very in their article
C10,childhood is evolutionary period that unfortunately is riddled with waste
C1,think briefly about the lifespan of goods during younger years everything from clothes to furniture and especially bikes is only necessary periods brief a few months
C1,but of course that is not the case
C1,if money and our planet were of no issue then that model would be fine
C2,in response dutch designers spencer rotting and sander letema created infento
C10,the good thing is that we offer a sustainable solution that let us you save hundreds of dollars
C10,you do not to buy new rides while your child grows up you simply construct a new ride together
C10,manuals that even kids can understand
C10,every kit and addon comes with a manual with clear and comprehensible instructions to build all the rides
C10,the instructions are very easy to follow and walk you through every step
C2,we only make use of clear images instead of long lines of text to ensure that both young and old both techy and nontechy can complete the rides in a smooth way how do we know sure
C5,from the feedback of teachers our manuals with the same type of instructions are already used by schoolchildren and they complete every task of our education kit with big smiles only
C10,of course you do not to follow our manual step by step
C10,you can creative and choose to make a slightly or completely different ride or structure from all the parts that come with the kit
C10,if you choose to go way the manual can show you how the different parts can work together
C10,all parts that were developed had to comply with two crucial criteria
C10,they needed to be super safe and they needed to be extremely durable
C2,we only took the next step in development when they fulfilled these two demands
C10,every part can always be reused another ride or structure
C10,year after year infento material can be transformed into new shapes
C1,would not it be great if you could hand over your kit to your grandson or granddaughter eventually
C6,that is exactly the goal we set ourselves in terms of quality
C10,below you can see example of our thinking in terms of safety
C10,in picture you see we chose a tooth belt instead of a chain
C10,why a tooth belt is much safer children a chain
C10,the core parts of all our rides are aluminum profiles of various lengths
C10,not only do they provide endless possibilities together with our modular connectors but they ensure that every ride is really super strong
C10,how strong every ride from our creator and master creator kit can easily hold the full weight of adult
C10,of course we recommend that you let your kid to the riding and you help out in constructing the rides
C6,the goal of infento was to develop education kit especially schools
C2,it took a lot of pioneering and innovating and great things achieved in the last years
C2,we offer our education kit since and schools in various countries use infento to give children a technical skill set
C5,the enormous positive feedback from children and parents made us decide to start with the development of construction kits families
C1,children build structures that are close to their experiences and make use of real materials and techniques
C10,the infento education kit uniquely combines creativity development of technical insight and fun
C10,learning with infento means that pupils to cooperate a lot
C2,they learn the powerful concept of teamwork and see how rewarding it is to work a shared goal
C10,infento is great all levels
C10,from initial introduction to technical structures and engineering to the highest level is building lifesize structures from their own imagination
C10,spencer left picture is a volunteer a youth organisation and there he came up with the idea to organize a race kids with rides they helped to build
C1,the kids loved building real stuff and they were really creative with the material that was available what would be possible with truly multifunctional and multiadjustable parts
C10,like lego and meccano but then life size
C2,spencer shared powerful idea with sander letema his brother in law
C2,sander immediately got very enthusiastic about the potential
C2,they both had their own companies in design and graphics at the time but they felt confident about concept that they started infento
C10,nothing like infento existed they had to design and invent every part and component themselves
C2,their background in design helped them to tackle the challenge to create parts and components that look beautiful together when assembled into a ride
C2,here you can see the very ride the kids from the youth organisation made five years ago
C2,ride eventually kickstarted the idea behind infento
C2,from there we started designing testing and developing like crazy is one of the rides that we developed
C10,it is hanging our ceiling of our workplace
C2,you can see from our kickstarter video and page that we already gone through multiple stages of development since we started the company
C2,we took the powerful idea from years ago a lot further and we designed it into the unique kits we offer
C6,below you will find the timeline starting at crowdfunding campaign until we deliver the product at your home
C2,we great team of partners and manufacturers lined up to make our kits you our supporter
C2,we already work with group since to deliver our education kits to schools
C6,therefore we full confidence in getting your kit at your doorstep according to the schedule below
C1,would not it be great if you could attach a real electric motor to your ride
C1,one that would give kids the feeling that they own their very own tesla
C2,we think we already started with the development of the infento edrive
C4,in the kickstarter video you saw alec our interviewer drive away our prototype
C2,while we were shooting the video he could not keep his hands off our electric ride
C4,check out upclose shot of our prototype edrive in the clip below
C10,you can attach the edrive to every ride with a tooth belt
C10,the edrive addon comes with a qualitative and very safe lithiumion battery that will power up your childs ride a long time before you to charge it again
C6,what is the amount of the stretch goal you wonder
C8,if we reach the stretch goal of every backer will the possibility to the edrive addon additional pledge of only
C7,if you come far and you read our complete kickstarter page thank you

C2,spencer where does invento stand at the moment
C2,alec our product is completly finished and we are ready to move
C5,the only thing we are missing is the support of the kickstarter community to scale up our production and to going
C2,okay alec i clearly forgot to tell you something
C2,we are developing the invento edrive we speak
C10,with the edrive we empower you to build real electric rides
C10,yet another cool reason to support invento
C2,do you anymore questions alec
C2,i think we lost our interviewer
C10,you see how cool it is
C7,support us
C2,while working assistant editor i would sit at the keyboard and type out every line that actor would say
C10,even with typing super fast the whole process would take times the actual length of the recording session
C10,while doing several days during a busy season i had idea that would escalate the speed of breaking down dialogue or marking takes others may know it
C10,i grabbed a sample script from final draft in pdf form and working creating a program that inputs your script with line numbers separates it line by line and allows you to click the line being read
C10,you click it creates a marker avid final cut pro or adobe premiere
C10,smart dx has split up the script into clickable lines
C10,that way when you back to your editing software you only to import your markers double check any mistakes you might made the fly and right to editing that material
C2,i found that takes the breaking down process from times the length of a recording session to times double checking and extreme dialogue treatment like marking each cough breath sigh etc that any actors might make
C10,smart dx in the avid
C2,i added a couple different colors of markers that go back to the last marker hit and change the color
C10,automatically the color is red but if you click yellow we use editors selectcircle take or blue director selectcircle smart dx will mark those takes you
C10,is not recording sessions though
C1,if you are any videographer or one man shop imagine you are shooting a client a corporate project and you audio recorder running non stop
C10,import your script into smart dx and mark your takes you go along
C10,process your footage and import the markers to your clip or sequence
C10,it is the closest thing to having a script supervisor set and will enable you to circle takes by choosing marker colors set

C2,our story
C2,cripple concepts was born out of necessity
C2,founder josh winkler is a mechanical engineer and a quadriplegic who uses a power wheelchair mobility who started the business after several friends asked devices he had created to make his own life easier
C10,what started personal inventions were soon being developed into shortrun products
C2,we are going big time or at least bigger time with a small production run
C6,if all goes will lead to larger production and development of assistive technology in collaboration with the colorado cross disability coalition outlined below
C1,disability rights including the right to earn a living without losing the essential medicaid services many people with disabilities to survive were not magically created
C1,it takes strong disability rights organizations to create and maintain them
C8,one such organization is the colorado cross disability coalition httpwwwccdconlineorg of all funds from kickstarter project will be donated to ccdc to help with disability advocacy
C6,if kickstarter is successful cripple concepts and ccdc will continue production of these and other products through a social enterprise collaboration that employs people with disabilities at living wages

C2,working a cooling device of the runoff power wheelchairs and hopefully down the road will into some bigger and better and fancy or devices that will make peoples lives better
C6,the money that were raising that round will allow us to buy some parts in bulk to put together a short production run served in some injection molding rather d printing all the housings and then if goes we will be able to launch into a larger production run a certain enough part of
C2,that said will show you around the shop a little bit with some of the tools we use to make the products and look forward to getting your contributions and you out some excellent products from cripple concepts and colorado cross disability coalition
C1,up we what most people think is the niftiest tool in the shop the solidoodle d printer working a wheelchair business card holder
C2,is i said earlier takes about hours to print
C2,next is example of d printed versions of the usb charger housings we will later be injection molding these
C2,we are going to into the testing of the usb charger the test rig with no load they pull a amp very minimal
C10,with iphone they pulled under amps is still very very minimal and finally with android phone they pull under amps
C10,yeah these devices pull very very minimal power off of a fully charged charger
C2,finally we the mini lads spinning up a build alluminum joystick knob is in the simple bullet shape later we will be adding shapes anodizing them in various colors but we are keeping it simple one shape
C7,thanks watching and we hope you are up contributing to excellent kickstarter helping both cripple concepts and the colorado cross disability coalition

C10,nora comes in a beautiful portable bag equipped with a rechargeable battery making it easy to use the go
C10,you can keep nora plugged in at home to keep the battery charged and ready to go
C9,the science behind nora
C1,why do we snore
C1,snoring is the result of our airways collapsing the upper throat muscles relax during sleep
C1,when we breathe through the narrowed airway we create vibrations that are heard snoring
C10,nora silently and gently moves your head using a lightweight padded insert that sits under the pillow
C10,slight movement stimulates the relaxed throat muscles
C10,a result the airway assumes its natural position and you can breathe normally once again
C10,our gold standard measuring the effectiveness of nora is the improved sleep of our testers
C10,nora helps restore natural breathing and significantly lowers the volume and repetition of snoring
C10,the improved quality of sleep experienced by our users is the result of overall reduction in volume of snoring
C4,nora has tested by our early users from weeks to months and counting
C5,users experienced a great improvement in the quality and continuity of sleep
C1,simply they are not waking up due to sounds of snoring or a partners nudge
C1,audible snoring at every inhale red is reduced in volume and repetition the same user after nora is activated blue
C10,the overnight comparison illustrates the aggregate effect of using nora the volume of snoring is reduced to a level below what wakes up a sleeping partner
C10,since noras sensitivity is adjustable the slow movement of nora can be set to activate only when snoring is about to reach volumes that wake up a particular person
C10,effect of using nora is that snoring volumes stay below the threshold that wakes up the partner
C10,you can hear the difference in the video when nora is working there is not much to see and that is exactly the point
C10,a noninvasive device the slow and small movement created by nora is what interrupts the snoring at the same time allowing the snorer and their partner to sleep through the night
C10,the nora system
C4,here is a demo of the fully functional prototype
C10,the mobile
C10,nora will ship with ios providing valuable insights into your snoring and sleep patterns
C10,while nora has its full functionality without the with the addition of the mobile you can receive your overnight audio recordings and see the effects of nora your snoring
C10,currently the design and user interfaces of the is complete and development is scheduled to begin in december
C5,we are looking forward to sharing the designs with our backers and getting their feedback in november before we begin development
C9,integration with apples healthkit is in our product roadmap and will provide the opportunity us and our scientific research partners to analyze the sleep data and alert users if they to consult with their family doctor based patterns that signal medical problems
C8,rewards
C5,our partners

C2,we maried since month dealing with snorring a couple about a year
C2,we are married many year i do not know how many year
C2,i was sceptical i think because we tried many options
C2,i do not to wear eraplugs is a huge benefit i found
C2,he is very easy with sleeping
C2,he can sleep anywhere
C2,the thing is in the morning it has very important in the morning you can tell that he slept
C2,before nora i would say my sleep was probably in average of about a how i was sleeping throughout the night because there are be times were there are bee bad weeks
C2,actually there were be times when will up and i went sleep the couch because i did not want to wake him and my sleep is probably about a or there has a huge improvement i would say
C2,i am extremly happy since i using nora
C10,the simple design is very effective
C2,i used to be a morning person and over the last year i struggled with that and it has unnatural me i think the biggest piece is i genuienly feel like i am sleeping better i fell refreshed in the morning
C2,it has the you know difference that makes a huge change in your lifestyle and in your sense of beeing i think is quite powerful
C2,hello my name is belarus thanks much making it far to our page
C4,we thought we give you a demo of how nora works all in one place
C4,these are actually some earlier prototypes of our pillow insert and you can see over time we find to our self the material
C10,is the final design is soft and there are no electronics in here we the fabric we within slots inside that build the structure that rises
C10,and we a ballon inside that inflates
C10,and the balloon is connected by tube to that mini pump and the silencer inside of case
C2,we actually uncovered you to see it
C10,is what holds all the electronics
C10,no electronics under your head everything under the bed
C10,and that case is identical to one
C2,we the tube connected to the airpump and we the input powerwhich you can see is connected to the powersource
C2,i am going to actually go ahead and click the bedsider turns the mini pump
C10,because it has picking up my voice something that is a little louder quite bedroom right
C10,you can see that starts rising and it has a very slow motion that takes arround seconds to go to the full hight is only about inches
C10,very small and very slow movement but that is the very movement that actually stimulates the upper through muscles and opens up the airway
C10,that has complete the motion and once it reaches the top it deflates and takes another seconds to go down
C10,and during seconds seconds rising up and seconds falling it has not activated based the noise
C10,it completes the loop
C2,i am going to turn it off that it does not react to my voice after the cycle is over and i willshow you one time how works inside of a pillow
C10,you can pick your favourite pillow it really does not matter how soft or hard the pillow is because what happens is you put under the pillow you can see it easily there we go
C10,i will turn it back and it will start rising again
C10,you will see because the structure is rising equally troughout the width of the pillow my head could be side or in the middle or the otherside and all of that is rising equally
C10,that is why you can sleep anywhere the pillow
C10,and the softness or the hardness of the pillow does not really matter because no matter where your head is that motion is transferred trough your pillow to you head
C10,you can keep your favourite pillow and keep using it
C2,i am going to keep stimulating weight of the head and it has going down and your head slowely goes back to the original position and by time your snorring has stopped
C2,i am going to turn it off and there you it
C7,that is how that is how nora works and we hope to see you a backer very soon
C1,whether you spend your evening chatting by the campfire or dancing all night at a festival being woken up at sunrise sucks
C1,less sleep means less energy to the full potential from the rest of your day or night we set out to improve the camping experience everyone and make bright overheating tents a thing of the past
C5,featured in
C10,the siesta is a four person tent made from a specially developed lightweight durable waterproof fly fabric that reflects infrared visible and ultraviolet light
C10,compared to typical nylon and polyester tents the siesta is dramatically cooler and darker inside when in direct sun
C10,the siesta is the worlds tent to feature ducted side vents into up to two ultraquiet inch usbpowered fans can be installed
C10,the fan draws cooling fresh air directly into the inner tent through a special fabric duct that connects the inner tent to the fly
C10,is especially useful when the doors are closed or if there is no breeze
C10,fan zips into the side of the inner tent
C10,note the circular air duct connecting the inner tent to the fly
C10,sure the siesta beats any other tent hands down in hot weather but what about rain wind and cold
C10,the full length fly and closable mesh give excellent protection when the weather turns nasty
C10,far better protection in fact a season tent
C10,we will even go far to claim the siesta is the most versatile tent ever made
C10,in terms of wind resistance aluminium poles full length pole sleeves and plenty of guy rope attachment points give you bestinclass performance
C5,in response to early feedback we already decided to add even guy rope attachments to the production model to help in very strong winds
C1,a common problem with tents when the temperature drops is condensation
C10,we got that covered too the inner tent is made from breathable polyester fabric combined with excellent airflow under the fly makes the siesta extremely condensationresistant
C10,waking up in the siesta is like waking up at home with the blindscurtains closed waking up in a tent
C10,unless you set your alarm chances are you will carry sleeping until you wake up naturally
C10,basically you will not be woken up by bright light and you will not feel a burst of heat when the sun hits your tent
C10,it has comparable to pitching a regular tent in complete shade such under a large tree only it has darker inside and you do not to find a tree or move your tent when the angle of the sun changes
C10,chart compares the air temperature inside the siesta to a tent made from regular tent fabric
C10,data was recorded a typical summer morning in spain
C10,a general rule in any climate the temperature inside the siesta remains relatively close to the temperature of the ambient air outside the tent
C10,we marked the chart the time at one fan was turned you can see the siesta is dramatically cooler a regular tent even without a fan running
C10,in example the doors were closed you can see how the fan helps keeps the temperature down when the tent is nice and dark inside
C10,real world temperature measurements
C10,by contrast the air inside a normal tent gets extremely hot
C10,in reality you would be much hotter the air temperature indicates because does not account the additional heat you feel a result of infrared radiation
C10,infrared energy does not heat the air it has only converted into heat when it has absorbed by your skin or your tent
C10,how dark is it
C10,a small amount of light comes in through the gap around the bottom of the fly
C10,is not enough to wake you up but it has enough to be able to find your way around the tent
C10,if you want light you can simply open the doors of the fly
C10,it has of a dim glow that is diffused by the wall of the inner tent
C10,siesta
C4,to accurately demonstrate the difference between fabrics we made identical tent out of standard tent polyester
C10,these two photos are taken using the exact same camera settings
C10,identical tent but made with a regular polyester fly
C10,comparing fly fabrics
C10,the siesta is a doublewalled design
C10,the inner tent is made from breathable polyester fabric t ripstop taffeta and has two huge double doors with full mesh panels
C10,there are two circular side vents with zips to attach the fans and there are two smaller mesh vents in the roof of the tent
C10,all the mesh panels can be zipped closed the inner tent can be fully protected against windborne sand and dust
C10,having two doors means both ends of the tent can be opened up great crossflow of air giving the best possible ventilation
C10,opening up all the doors turns the tent into a great hangout space if you a break from the heat during the day
C10,in crowded campsites such festivals the tent can be easily pitched without guy ropes stake out the corners and vestibules
C10,of course we advise you to add extra stakes and guy ropes if it has likely to be very windy
C10,only four poles and a familiar dome style design means the intuitive setup is quick and easy
C10,the inner tent can be left clipped in everything can be pitched in one go
C10,other features include
C10,high quality aluminium poles strength and durability
C10,full length pole sleeves additional structural stability
C10,vestibules give loads of storage space bags cooler etc
C10,adjustable fly door positions using toggles the inside make it easy to increase ventilation without letting in too much light
C10,highsided heavyduty waterproof floor
C10,top quality ykk zippers
C10,central lantern loop
C10,additional hanging loops
C10,mesh storage pockets
C10,power cord access zippers
C10,reflective guy ropes
C10,looking straight up
C2,we spent many months developing our unique ultrareflective fly fabric
C10,the base fabric is t polyester taffeta cloth the same is used to make other high quality tents
C10,the difference is that ours undergoes a special process that applies a reflective coating one side and a polyurethane coating the other
C10,both coatings are waterproof and the seams are sealed at the factory with industry standard pu seam tape
C10,means you can repair the fly with a standard tent repair kit should any accidental damage occur always apply the repair patch to the underside of the fly not the reflective side
C4,to demonstrate how reflective our fly fabric is heres a comparison with some other materials using infrared thermal camera
C10,image shows several different fabrics placed a hotplate
C10,fabric comparison using thermal camera
C10,the dark colour is due to aluminium cooking foil and our fabric both having low emissivity they do not radiate much heat shows that they are excellent heat reflectors
C10,in contrast normal polyester tent fabric absorbs and radiates heat very is why it has almost the same colour the hotplate itself
C10,you can see even dramatic effect when the whole tent is viewed by a thermal camera hot sunny day
C10,siesta viewed with infrared thermal camera
C10,in a camping world we designed a ducted vent system that keeps out heat and light whilst allowing fresh air in from outside
C10,a fabric air duct connects opening in the inner tent to the vent the fly and the outer end of the duct has insect mesh bugs cannot use you a tasty treat
C10,ducted side vent with cover rolled up
C10,inside the tent the vent opening can be left uncovered natural ventilation or one of our custom fans can be zipped in
C10,the duct can be left in place when the tent is rolled up but the fans to be removed and packed separately
C4,prototype fan with usb power bank
C10,the fan can be run from any usb power source power consumption is very low less watts battery life is not a problem
C10,we recommend portable rechargeable power banks like the ones used to charge cell phones and tablets andor solar charging kits
C10,example of typical rechargeable power bank
C10,each fan will be supplied with with a v usb compatible power cord
C7,please let us know if you would like a cord v batteries andor v car outlets we will add if there is sufficient demand
C10,most camping trips a portable battery usb power bank will run the fan a few hours each day without needing to be recharged
C2,we evaluated the options supplying our own portable battery packs but we cannot currently compete with the prices you can find online from amazon ebay etc
C2,therefore we created a table to give you idea of what size battery to buy
C5,we recommend buying from a reputable brand check the online reviews not all battery packs provide much real world capacity the suppliers claim
C10,if in doubt buy a slightly larger capacity pack you think you will
C10,if you want to run two fans simply double the capacity and choose a model with x usb outputs or buy two battery packs
C10,if you wish to use the same battery pack to charge your cell phone or other devices while camping do not forget to add extra capacity those devices
C1,example a mah power bank should last most people a week of camping without needing to be recharged
C10,a battery of size can be purchased very cheaply examples search usb power bank your favourite online shopping site
C10,what about solar
C10,you can use offtheshelf solar panel to recharge your usb battery pack
C10,many brands supply portable solar kits that are compatible with their batteries
C7,please note that small portable solar panels generally will not be powerful enough to run the fan by themselves without being connected to a rechargeable battery
C10,is because motors a burst of power to start up and then once they are running the power requirement decreases
C10,therefore a small solar panel may not enough power to start the fan motor but once the fans running it can happily keep your battery topped up
C2,we love solar but in many cases a usb power bank will last a whole camping trip without needing a recharge
C10,solar panels are typically expensive usb power banks you may find it has cheaper to buy a battery with enough capacity to last a whole trip buy a portable solar panel
C7,if you any help deciding option is best you please feel free to contact us advice please note we do not recommend or endorse specific brands
C2,since the proof of concept was made back in sydney almost a year ago we hard at work developing our fabric and refining the design
C2,the very proof of concept was made using the frame of offtheshelf person tent
C2,comparing the proof of concept to a regular tent
C4,the fan test used a computer cooling fan
C10,type of fan is actually a very good fit our requirement they are very efficient and do not use much power
C10,ever fan experiment to test the effect temperature
C2,we refined the design using regular polyester whilst we were developing the reflective fabric
C4,prototype using regular polyester fabric at the factory rd center
C4,we tested the tent manufacturing process using several different reflective fabric technologies before selecting the best one the job
C10,sewing seamsealing the reflective fabric
C8,we will local shipping from warehouses in the us australia and uk
C8,the rest of the world we will ship to from whichever warehouse is closest to you
C8,if there is enough interest from other countries we will do our best to arrange local shipping and refund the difference
C8,shipping costs australia uk and eu countries include local taxes where applicable
C8,other international destinations we estimated a base shipping fee that covers most countries however additional shipping and local taxes may apply
C7,please contact us if you would like estimate
C8,after completion of the campaign you will receive a questionnaire to confirm your shipping details and we will organise accurate international quotes at that time
C2,outback logic llc is a us company founded by gareth price sally slarke and brandon beck
C2,we are a team of entrepreneurs from australia america and england who got together to bring gareths idea a heatreflective lightblocking tent to life
C2,we are a multidisciplinary bunch with a wealth of commercial experience we partnered with leading fabric tent and specialist coating manufacturers to develop a worldclass product and make the siesta a reality
C2,gareth originally had the idea while camping at a festival in the australian outback
C9,having camped in a number of warm climates including australia southern europe california and nevada he realised there was huge potential a heatreflective tent and undertook extensive research design and development to prove the concept and ensure commercial viability
C2,why are we here
C2,the manufacture of tents at a competitive price is only possible at highvolume especially we are producing our own custom fabric is complicated and expensive typical tent fabrics
C6,the development work is all completed but we the funds to meet or hopefully exceed the various factory minimum order requirements and place our production orders
C7,we cannot bring the siesta to market without your help if you like what you seen please spread the word and consider backing our project
C7,thank you
C1,camping gives us amazing opportunities to explore remote destinations climb new heights make new friends and experience epic festivals but there is always a catch after sunrise tents are often too hot or too bright many of us don t enough sleep
C1,imagine the possibilities if we had all the rest we needed we energy to explore further be adventurous and even fun
C2,that is why we created the siesta a revolutionary new tent
C10,engineered from the ground up to give you the best possible sleep outdoors even in blazing sunshine
C10,when the sun comes up our game changing ultra reflective fly fabric blocks infrared visible and ultraviolet light dramatically reducing the temperature and brightness inside the tent
C10,extra comfort you can add a ultra quiet usb fans that zip right into the custom vents drawing fresh air from outside
C10,the full length fly provides maximum protection from wind and rain while the breathable innertent prevent condensation and closable mesh keeps out dirt and cold drafts
C10,gives you incredible all weather versatility
C2,inspired by the cold nights and sweltering early mornings when camping in the australian outback we set out to solve the problem of bright overheating tents once and all and siesta was born
C2,we spent the past year designing developing and testing from fabrics to fans every aspect of the tent has meticulously thought out
C2,to ensure the highest possible standards we selected only premium quality materials and partnered with one of the worlds leading tent manufacturers
C4,with the prototypes finished we are ready to launch but we your help to meet the factory minimums
C7,if you like what you seen please tell your friends and if you would like a seriously badass tent back our project

C1,fashion should function
C2,there we said it
C2,at ziptank we think that whatever you wear has to serve a second or third purpose
C1,most shirts they are shirts
C1,most pants they are pants
C1,most tank tops you the point
C2,that is why we created ziptank the worlds most useful tank top
C10,it is a top you will not be naked and it is bag that you can use anything
C5,featured in
C2,a proud chicago native kaeya felt it was important to create local jobs to bring her idea to life
C2,we hired a team of underserved and previously unemployed seamstresses in the south side of chicago to manufacture our ziptanks
C1,imagine a regular tank top with a durable reliable zipper the bottom
C10,that is ziptank simple right
C2,to us user simplicity is absolute must
C10,the entire experience is smooth and seamless
C3,ziptanks patented zipper design is leakproof and durable
C10,what designs can i
C10,choose from our city series below to rep your home town or come up with your own art and send it over to us
C2,the people behind ziptank
C2,with a strong team of designers and branding experts behind ziptank we got functional fashion and want to bring it to you
C2,cofounder kaeya majmundar shark tank star and serial entrepreneur
C2,strategic partner jermaine dupri hit american record producer and songwriter
C2,brand ambassador roc nation rapper vic mensa
C7,we your help
C2,ziptanks are sweeping the nation and cannot fill our orders fast enough
C7,thanks watching video
C2,i am ka and i a zip tank
C10,at glance it probably looks like a bag but you can take yourself out unzipp the bottom and wear it a tank top
C1,you know how when you stare at something long enough things start to fuzzy
C2,that happen with the plastic bag and it started looking like a tank top to me
C2,then i figured if you slap a zipper at the bottom of a tank top you can turn it into a bag or where it is a shirt
C1,you are probably wondering why you would ever want to do that
C10,one you could use it a laundry bag
C10,gave here a lot of laundry to do but he does not a laundry bag to put it in
C10,he does a zip tank he is putting all of his dirty clothes into the ziptank and then he is going to throw the whole thing straight into the laundry machine
C10,ziptank can come in handy at the gym
C10,wear it in the gym do you work out and then throw your dirty clothes into it and carry with the rest of your day
C3,far i pitched up tank in a couple of business pitch competitions and use the prize money to secure a patent applications manufacturing and develop a solid team
C6,k will go towards developing a solid website stocking up inventory and securing licenses with sports teams music artist festivals and colleges
C2,you are probably thinking that is a whole lot to do in a very little amount of time and it is but i am confident that my experience bringing products to market will come in handy
C2,you may recognize me from the season finale of abc shark tank where i landed a deal my collapsible storage box concept busybox
C2,i learned a lot from that process and i am thrilled to bring you my next innovation

C2,pet lovers we are unable to help ourselves from taking tons pictures of them
C1,sometimes you want to grab a shot of their good looking mug and share it with the world
C1,any dog owner will tell you it is difficult to your pet to sit still long enough a picture let alone catch them looking into the camera
C1,a selfie with your dog is nearly impossible task
C2,to help solve these problems i am proud to introduce the pooch selfie
C10,pooch selfie is a smartphone attachment helps pet owners take better pictures and selfies with their dogs
C10,pooch selfie takes advantage of a dogs natural draw and focus to a tennis ball and uses focus to hold their gaze you snap away that perfect portrait picture
C10,turn the attention to your smartphones front facing camera and use pooch selfie to capture the best selfies you will ever take with your pup some extra incentive
C10,simply remove the pooch selfie ball a few squeaks and regain your dogs focus and then place back into the attachment some awesome pics
C10,each pooch selfie comes with a squeaking pooch selfie ball and custom cell phone attachment
C10,pooch selfie is specifically designed to be used with iphones and galaxys however works universally with most smartphones and tablets
C4,after a year of design development and prototyping pooch selfie is ready to go to market
C2,we are prepared to kick off a production tool and submit order mass quantities

C2,we qualified and selected highly reliable manufacturing partners to provide each component of pooch selfie
C2,we feel very confident that our suppliers will deliver quality parts to schedule
C8,following the kickstarter funding period we will kick off tooling with our suppliers and proceed to article inspection and production sample qualification estimated time weeks
C6,once parts passed our review quality assurance we will initiate production orders all components and establish a doc date to our san diego ca warehouse estimated time weeks
C6,when all components are received we will commence with final assembly and packaging and ship out immediately estimated time weeks
C2,what is up kickstarter my name is jason from san diego and we live in a selfie driven world
C1,see every moment and experience we is quickly snapped away our smartphones and cherished until the end of time or until the zombie apocalypse
C1,it seems the only ones that did not the memo about locking these moments away and time is our furry little friends
C1,we long a picture perfect moment with our pets they are too busy looking at squirrels yap squirrels
C2,got me thinking had anybody perfected the art of taking a picture or selfie with your pets that would be a solution to everyday problem of ours i searched and searched to the end of the internet and i found nothing
C2,i sat there looking at my laptop i literally had a face to palm
C2,the answer has sitting in front of me all time and i thought why did not i think of that and then i realized oh yeah i did that happened
C10,introducing the pooch selfie the pooch selfie is a smartphone attachment harnesses your dogs natural draw and focus to a tennis ball and uses its magical powers to help you take better pictures and selfies whith your pet
C10,weather you are taken a picture of your pop or one with furrious friends pooch selfie will help you nabbed those moments with far better results ever before

C10,it was designed both iphones and androids however works universally with most smartphones and tablets
C10,to install pooch selfie simply slide the plastic component onto your smartphone and place the ball into the class game device
C10,you notice there are clearances both front and rear facing cameras
C10,allows you to toggle between portrait style pics and selfies without having to remove the device
C10,our pets are quite unpredictable and even with the sorcery that these tennis balls hold their interest begins to fade
C10,each pooch selfie comes with a squeaking ball to grab that extra ounce of attention from our pets and put them up additional glamour shots
C10,even incentive not to worry pooch selfies ball disengages from the classic mechanism and you can regain your pups focus with a couple rounds of fetch
